# STA-141B-Final-Project
Dyson Smith &amp; Jeremy Elvander's STA-141B Final Project

  This project aims to explore the relationship between the onlime perceptions of San Francisco's eight Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations and reported crime in the surrounding area's of the stations. Specifically, we want to examine if crime within a mile radius of San Francisco BART Stations is correlated to negative online perceptions about the station.

  We plan to levrage the BART's API to map the locations of the eight stations, DATASF's Open Data API to map crime in the area's surrounding BART Stations, and scrape reviews from Yahoo Reviews of the eight BART Stations to perform setiment analysis to determine if they generally have a negative or positive public perception.
