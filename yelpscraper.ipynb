I go to the attendant to explain that the machine appears to be frozen/broken. She replies rudely that: ITS NOT BROKEN GO BACK. She says: does it say please remove card to continue? I say yes. She says it's not broken. I go back very confused because the folks in line in front of me and I all tried to press every button, look for obstructions in the card area and the screen did not unfreeze from the card message. I go back to find yet another person pressing buttons trying to get it to work. They leave and then I attempt again while other people are now at the attended to report the same issue. The screen then flips to out of service. I begin to walk back and she then yells: GO BACK I JUST RESET IT. Everyone looks angry and annoyed at the back and forth.

      "  Review 84: Embarcadero Bart is nicer than most other San Francisco stations but I still have a few grievances against Embarcadero. First is that maintenance never seems to make any progress with the escalators. I've been commuting into this station for over a year now and I believe there's been more days when the escalators have been \"under construction\" than it has been usable.  This creates a huge jam both getting on the platform and getting out of the station.  With people lugging around bulky luggage, strollers and bicycles, it becomes almost a safety problem.  Even worse, there are people that are completely unable to walk down the stairs and must wait in a long line to use the elevator.  Another problem is that when the elevators are actually working, they're going in the opposite direction of traffic (i.e. there are two people needing to get off the platform at 5pm after work and closer to 50 people trying to get on the platform).  Hopefully the elevator situation will be fixed soon to alleviate the barrage of people scrambling to make their train.\n",

Also available at this station is Muni Buses, which will take you deep into the city of SF/parts of Daly City etc...  This is a pretty huge station, about 2 SF blocks long.  If you're a SF native, you def know how long a block is!! LOL.  As a daily commuter,  I do enter and exit this station (M-F).  Luckily traveling from Fremont, Embarcadero is my stop coming to work every morning (M-F).  It's not as clean as we would like it to be, but its SF... the whole city needs a little cleaning!! =) Staircase smells like piss.. escalators are always out of service, elevators always going under construction (which causes the staircases to be congested), never a formal line, people always trying to hop in a train car when its super full, and don't care if the door jams.  In which case I hate, because then you hear the attendant yelling over the intercom \"THE TRAIN IS FULL, THERE WILL BE ANOTHER XXX Train in 3 min, DOORS ARE CLOSING **ding\" LOL.

In which case, this station can get super crowded, and at that time be prepared to miss at least (2) trains before you can hop on one that is \"almost\" full when heading home.  I'd advise to take any of the outbound trains going towards Daly City/Millbrae or SF Airport.  And get off at the previous station Montgomery or Powell.  You will def catch a less full train car at either station.  For the most part, BART is just super convenient and inexpensive compared to Cal Train.\n",

Then both rows simultaenously step back into line, allowing people to line up in the order they were in originally (minus the people who boarded).

Also, what is up with the wrope figure by BART that has so much dirt on it?\n",

Yelp even went a little bit far and claimed that the Van Ness Muni station was also a BART station.  I must have corrected that listing five times before they finally changed it.  But now they've gone and separated some of the true BART-Muni combos.  I guess I get what I deserve sometimes.\n",

      "  Review 408: So at about 4:30pm today, I walked down to the station. A train had already passed heading THAT WAY (Dublin/Oakland blah blah.. so is that inbound or outbound). Who knows? Platform 2 dammit! I walked down a bit to find myself a seat. And about 1 or 2 minutes later, the systems says blah blah blah train in blah blah blah minutes (1 or 2 I'm guessing). Next thing I knew, there was a line of white people (No literally, and one Asian) lined up single-f**king file starting from the platform 1 side and curved down to platform two w/ a little curve. What the f**k is going on here? That was seriously the first time I witnessed that. So I thought to myself.. okay... maybe these people in the EMBARCADERO are extremely polite! Or maybe everyone is just trying to get to Dublin/Pleasanton. But next thing you know, my train towards the Daly City way comes and BAM! I didn't even get a chance to witness the line form. It was already there when I got up and took a step. I still hadn't processed the first line from PLATFORM 1! Now there are TWO (maybe even more that I was in too much of a shock to see) LINES formed by platform 1. Except these lines were more considerate and stayed on the platform 2 side (horizontal instead of vertical). The two lines approximately started where they KNEW the doors were going to end up at.

Thank you Christina! Christina really came through for me. She was professional and very knowledgeable and she has a beautiful heart because she saved me a lot of money for sure. Thank you Christina of the Montgomery Bart Station! I appreciate you and forever will be grateful. She also called a day later to check and see if I got my bag which to me is great customer service!

Not all the ticket scanners have functioning Clipper card scanners, in addition, the gates don't follow the flow of people either trying to get out of or into the station which further increases the lines. For example, during the morning commute 3 of 6 gates on the Market 500 exit allow people to exit, but only 2 allow Clipper cards?!

One extra star because the station is open and generally clean. The stations are pretty few and far between, so each one is necessary. The signage on BART is some of the worst and most confusing of any public transit, in my opinion. Several trains on the same track, no sins on the trains themselves so you have to look at the flashing sign and you have to be pretty well versed with the train lines to be sure you're getting on the right one, and you have to decide quickly. Also, the cost these days is about the same to over a third of the cost of a Lyft ride. They need to make it as convenient as Lyft if they want to continue to compete.\n",

During the commute hours it gets so crowded, granted it's the financial district so a majority of the people who work down town get on and off there. The problem with the Montgomery station is that things don't always work, which just adds to the lines and crowds. Not all the ticket scanners have functioning Clipper card scanners, in addition, the gates don't follow the flow of people either trying to get out of or into the station which further increases the lines. For example, during the morning commute 3 of 6 gates on the Market 500 exit allow people to exit, but only 2 allow Clipper cards?! I mean, given the flow of people there should be like 4-5 of 6 gates allowing for exit, that would help cut down on lines of people.

I keep hearing about propositions to increase the quality of Bart, but have not seen anything to date. The seats are absolutely disgusting and I would highly, highly recommend you to stand, even if a seat is available. If you look closely at the seat, you'll notice that they're often discolored - brown. If you really must sit, be sure to put some newspaper down on the seat first. \n",

I came back in an hour and talked to a different woman named Keeta (sp?), who also did a page and called to the other stations to see if they had found it. I think she must called about 3 of them before giving me the good news that someone had turned it in AND it had all my stuff in it. (Maybe I should review the good people of SF next.)

I've had nothing but terrific experiences, both getting off here and getting on--super convenient, dropping me off centrally in the city. I know people complain all the time about how it's dirty and expensive, but frankly, I don't see it. Maybe my standards are low or maybe I don't expect as much or maybe I'm just so freakin grateful I have this service. The ride I love, because unlike Caltrain which is bumpy and noisy, BART is smooth and gliding. I also love that there's an announcer--is it automated or an actual person? But whatever it is, it actually announces your stop every step of the way. It takes me all the way from the peninsula to the city! It's fairly clean inside and you can choose wherever you want to sit. For someone who's as spatially challenged as I am, the organization and layout of this station is fantastic--clear signs everywhere--exits and signs to further destinations clearly marked. no confusion whatsoever. This is a testimony to whomever designed it because I usually get lost wherever I go, but did I ever get lost, even my first time there? No! So I'm happy and grateful this is an option for me!\n",

I haven't used this station without being harassed by tweakers, or watching someone get harassed.

There seems to be no regular effort to wet mop the place to remove the urinetown smell of the station and there were excrements on the floor as well!!!!  I think that Bart needs to hire janitors that has clear statement of work and cleanliness standard. I heard that Bart anitors get paid a lot but I am not sure if there are any cleanliness standard.  They need to hire professional cleaners who will professionally clean this place. I thought that with the Bart fares, Bart management will make an effort to clean all the Bart Stations and trains.

Bart needs to massively improve its cleanliness and need to enforce non loitering. It seems that on a daily basis the seats and floors do not get wiped or mopped as you can still smell in the morning  and all day trace of all kinds of body fluids. Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.\n",

I realized too late the true missing amount (due to #UNBELIEVABLE thoughts racing through my mind including hearing the TRAINS #PASSING by SO #MANY times underground while another #RUDE customer cuts in about #minor simplicities), but it's over and too much of a hassle to go through. I'm grateful for all the customer service had to offer. I will take #EXTRA #PRECAUTIONS and  be EXTRA #CAUTIOUS next time I use Bart. * BE SURE TO #CALCULATE THE CHEATED DIFFERENCE BEFORE REIMBURSEMENT EVEN IF IT ISN'T YOUR JOB (you can thank me later.) I'm starting out in life and pay income for proposed jobs are similar where I'm from and don't have to take Bart. Now I can choose to work local and dramatically cut costs, time, and unnecessary hassles such as easily magnetized/messed up cards and losing very hard earned money. Nowadays, everything is about profit so we have to pinch every cent and dollar even more to invest and for emergencies.  I'M GLAD I LEARNED A GREAT #LESSON TODAY AND CAN NOW EASILY MAKE #INFORMED DECISIONS. It wasn't worth it what I went through. Bart should up their game and should have allowed the same benefits on plastic cards ever since plastic cards came into being. I never had this issue at other stations while I extensively went to school. Or rarely any issue for that matter except at Bayfair and especially here - when they allowed magnetized paper cards to be traded for several new ones in split amounts for more money added.

I think that Bart needs to hire janitors that has clear statement of work and cleanliness standard. I heard that Bart anitors get paid a lot but I am not sure if there are any cleanliness standard.

Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety.

As expected, when it got to Powell St station, a thousand Chinese people got on, returning from their grocery shopping in Chinatown. The train became packed like sardines in a can. I was sitting in the isle seat pushed part way into the isle by a portly woman with two big bags. Well, here's where it got interesting: A young Chinese girl, probably 18 to 25 who was standing in the isle ajacent to me, got all shoved up against my arm and shoulder. I didn't mind, as that is the nature of riding the muni. After awhile I noticed a kind of strange motion of her body! Was this my imagination I thought?  No, it actually was happening!  She was busy softly humping my arm!  I'm 74 but I can assure you everything still works.and she was doing a great job of getting the juices going! I sat there and waited to see how long she would keep it up. At  Forrest Hill station she started to pick up the tempo and intensity. There was no doubt she was enjoying what she was doing. At West Portal station, most of the passengers departed. The isle was empty, yet she was still pressed tightly against my arm doing her thing. I looked up at her, she appeared to be staring at the ceiling of the car. Well anyway, she got off at 19th Ave. As she was leaving, I told her discreetly \"Thank You, that was very pleasant !\" She just gave me one of those weird Chinese girl smiles and departed. This was the best Muni ride I have yet. Thank you again whoever you are young lady for making my ride so enjoyable. I doubt that you will ever read this review but  Thanks again!\n",

On the rail you don't have to keep the driver in check to make sure he's not screwing you.  That's nice.

It's hard to capture exactly what makes it so compelling, how you stack rap lyrics over mournful guitar chords.  Obviously with just you and the guitar, you have stripped much of the songs away - the bass, the production, the sampling - most of hip-hop's signifiers.  And as someone walking by, unless you already know and recognize the songs, you might not even know that's what's being performed.  I loved so much when you did the theme to \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air\" and segued right into \"Going Back to Cali\" by Biggie Smalls as though it were an extra verse.

You give us whole new songs.  This morning you were singing \"Shook Ones\" by Mobb Deep.

      "  Review 1: It's been years since I've ridden BART, but Civic Center station was ultra convenient to the Orpheum Theater for the closing day of the Wicked tour. My mom and aunt and I felt safe on the train from Bay Fair. The train cars themselves are newer to me, digital line maps and seats clean. Clipper Card tap system as well. Civic Center also had different fare doors, full height to prevent hop overs. When my auntie had trouble with the Clipper Card tapping, an agent was there to assist. Took the stairs and not the escalator, but for a Sunday at noontime the station wasn't bad in terms of crowds or cleanliness. Nor was it bad after the show got out around 4ish. Since the expansion, I wasn't familiar with the lines going to \"Antioch\" (for me that used to be Pittsburgh/Bay Point terminus) or \"Berryessa\" (Fremont).\n",

I've even witnessed leftover bottles of alcohol. I've also never seen security here. The only times I've had was during the pride parade in SF as there are many bart goers that day. Because of this, I often feel unsafe and have to watch out for myself. For instance, last week I had just gotten off the train and was heading towards the escalator. As I was heading straight, I noticed a white woman with short hair peeking around the corner. I think she was on something because she had her mouth hanging open and was swirling around her tongue. I quickly walked past her but she ended up following me. Luckily, giving her a stern glare was enough to make her back off but if things were to break out then I would have been in trouble. I think it's important that a security guard is always present in case of instances like this turning into something more. This is also not the first time where someone has tried to follow me or even pickpocket me. Please remember to be cautious of your belongings and on the lookout whenever you use bart. You can't rely on security to have your back.\n",

There was a cute little family (dad and daughters) dressed in Christmas clothing playing instruments (I should have taken a pic, sorry friends!). The only staff I saw was the agent which is interesting given the size and location of the Civic Center Station. The benefit to using the station is its proximity to downtown SF, namely the Orpheum Theater. It's literally not even three blocks away. Quite a bit of homeless persons were around the stadium but everyone was minding their business (wanted to share that as I know many have concerns but we were fine). When we returned to the station hours later the escalator was still down (one was handicapped in our party so it was an inconvenience). No signage, not safety cones or anything blocking the area off, and it was slippery and wet out. Not a safe way to operate the station, Civic Center.\n",

There's people sleeping on the floor, there's open and blatant drug use for lack of concern being caught or fined with a misdemeanour and a ticket. It's always such a station that you must use but keep your valuables, cell phones especially from view and use until you're safely on your train going wherever your going. The platform is in a second sub-level as Muni rail is the first sub-level and you have to take an escalator down to the platform and back up when exiting the fare paid area of the BART system. Half the time the escalators are broken down and you have to walk up the thousands of steps to the surface or down to the train platform. This station is notorious for being one of three which those wanting to commit suicide decide to step in front of approaching trains causing system wide delays and a huge police and medical personnel. I'd avoid it if I could but it's the station closest to my house so I have to put up with the terrible conditions and state of things.\n",

In writing this review, I did a quick search to find some history on the station, but haven't been able to find anything substantial. If I'm not mistaken there are a number of transportation stations which various groups have taken efforts to recognize or preserve immediately or in the future because of cultural or historic significance, although I'm not entirely sure who they are or how this process works. The Civic Center itself seems to have been recognized as a National Historic Landmark District. Not sure if this includes the BART Station.\n",

I wouldn't be surprised if decibels levels inside the train could cause permanent hearing damage for people who take the train everyday. I wish lawsuit was filed against them.

Watch out for homeless people skipping the ticket machines. They are usually harmless, but during low traffic periods like Saturday morning, there are not that many security around. The overhead speaker system will shout out good citizen propaganda like reporting suspicious activity. The trains get continual time updates on the board, so you don't have to question when your train is about to arrive.

With some law enforcement up top on the street at the entrances, law enforcement even walking the platform! There are some upgrades downstairs, lighting replacement (some, but lots more need replacement consideration), and a generally cleaner station! It has been shown to increase ridership occurs when you give them a clean and safe place! Someone is caring!\n",

It's an insurmountable amount of per. Gallons and gallons of urine they mop up every single day. The drugs. You could probably get anything you want. I get asked if I'm looking for anything each day as I hit the down escalator. Except when there is law enforcement presence, they spread out a bit but they're there. Pee and drugs is enough to one star any place. One could spend hours ready about this place. My review is but another sentence in a gigantic book. And the story goes on and on...Kudos to and and all who chose to work at this station. You are stronger than most. FIVE STARS FOR ALL THAT WORK AT CIVIC CENTER BART STATION!\n",

I feel really bad for the people that have to work at this particular station because it is probably one of the most challenging stations on the system, in the state, and probably a close second to whatever New York or Chicago has for challenges. The influence of the immediate surrounding area makes it next to impossible to cure. From the drug dealers, drug users and other people who urinate on the platform. Yuk! I went to the Powell street station and was amazed about how clean it looked and smelled. I should say, the lack of smell. Here you smell the urine and if you don't pay close attention, you could end up with an oily shoe!\n",

The people that have to clean it up daily are to be giving high marks for the nasty work they do.

      "  Review 232: I try to avoid this station when I can as I've had repeated bad experiences at this stop. The place tends to smell like urine and there are many sticky surfaces to watch out for. I've even witnessed leftover bottles of alcohol. I've also never seen security here. The only times I've had was during the pride parade in SF as there are many bart goers that day. Because of this, I often feel unsafe and have to watch out for myself. For instance, last week I had just gotten off the train and was heading towards the escalator. As I was heading straight, I noticed a white woman with short hair peeking around the corner. I think she was on something because she had her mouth hanging open and was swirling around her tongue. I quickly walked past her but she ended up following me. Luckily, giving her a stern glare was enough to make her back off but if things were to break out then I would have been in trouble. I think it's important that a security guard is always present in case of instances like this turning into something more. This is also not the first time where someone has tried to follow me or even pickpocket me. Please remember to be cautious of your belongings and on the lookout whenever you use bart. You can't rely on security to have your back.\n",

In writing this review, I did a quick search to find some history on the station, but haven't been able to find anything substantial. If I'm not mistaken there are a number of transportation stations which various groups have taken efforts to recognize or preserve immediately or in the future because of cultural or historic significance, although I'm not entirely sure who they are or how this process works. The Civic Center itself seems to have been recognized as a National Historic Landmark District. Not sure if this includes the BART Station.\n",

She looked back at me with a scowl and puzzled look. So I then said, City Hall. This sister then rolled her eyes at me as if I insulted her or was difficult. So I asked, did I offend you in some way? And she bluntly replied that my question was not asked properly. Rolled eyes from one black woman to another means that she's dismissing me, that I don't matter and what I want doesn't matter. I asked her her name and she rudely replied, \"Station Agent\". She then put her hand up to the window in my face. With BART having all the recent bad press and the Civic Center is where many dignitaries and community advocates use, she made a mistake with me. I will be sharing my experience at the BART Board.\n",

The elevators are equally as disgusting and somehow the escalators always seem to be broken and you have to go up and down the stairs which sucks considering that this bart station happens to be one is the lowest bart stations. Avoid taking this bart station late at night or anytime after 7pm for that matter. Carry around pepper spray or mini taser if you absolutely have to take bart from this station. If you can get off at Powell St, it's not a whole lot better but better than Civic.\n",

These Bart employees make way to much money and don't care about anything. This problem has gotten out of control. How many people were doing drugs here to have that many syringes. Was 915am.

No standards on how the operator should announce each station as each one does it differently and some lazy ones don't even try. I wouldn't be surprised if decibels levels inside the train could cause permanent hearing damage for people who take the train everyday. I wish lawsuit was filed against them.

Watch out for homeless people skipping the ticket machines. They are usually harmless, but during low traffic periods like Saturday morning, there are not that many security around. The overhead speaker system will shout out good citizen propaganda like reporting suspicious activity. The trains get continual time updates on the board, so you don't have to question when your train is about to arrive.

The platform is in a second sub-level as Muni rail is the first sub-level and you have to take an escalator down to the platform and back up when exiting the fare paid area of the BART system. Half the time the escalators are broken down and you have to walk up the thousands of steps to the surface or down to the train platform. This station is notorious for being one of three which those wanting to commit suicide decide to step in front of approaching trains causing system wide delays and a huge police and medical personnel. I'd avoid it if I could but it's the station closest to my house so I have to put up with the terrible conditions and state of things.\n",

Madison like any dog, loves walks and other dogs. Knowing this, as they rode the escalator, my brother took Madison out of her bag and put her on the escalator. This particular escalators grate at the top is elevated just a bit too much, so things get stuck time to time at the top of the escalator. As a human, we are smart enough to step over it and walk on. As a 12lbs, foot long dog who is shaky in general on escalators, your hind leg's paw gets stuck in the moving escalator. And when you're a tiny puppy who's paw is slowly being sawed off you yelp repeatedly, loudly, and desperatly. \n",

A couple of guys who are always hanging out on that corner instantly ran down the stairs to get the BART attendant who was working at the booth next to the elevator to the platforms on the 7th street side of the station. She came over eventually- but it was someone else who turned the escalator off using the emergency kill switch. Only problem was Madison's foot was still stuck in the escalator. Passengers, store owners, neighbors, tourists were all throwing ideas to the attendent who seemed content just to stand there and stare with everyone else. Finally she went to call BART police. Or at least she claimed to have called- they never arrived even though their sub station is at Powell ST and at 10 am there is a train arriving from Powell St every 2 to 5 minutes.\n",

I have business that brings me to that exit three times a week, and has for years. I always stop at the little coffe shop for a can of soda and a pack of mints.

Although he is not very good at playing the violin, his passion shines thru.   Sometimes you might be lucky to catch him playing the guitar and writing his music on his music sheet.

      "  Review 23: I've been through this station maybe 5 times before tonight, over the last 10 years living in the Bay area (not in SF). I made the trip in from Oakland, to meet my hubby to meet friends for dinner. I knew that this station has always been unsavory, so I was hesitant to go back there. I was not happy to have to walk up the super long staircase, upon arrival, due to the escalator being out  of service. As expected, when I got to street level, I was instantly disgusted by lots of homeless guys (and maybe one gal) hanging out right there, just like I've seen before. My hubby was waiting for me a few steps away from them. Our dinner went a bit later than I thought it would, and thank god the muscular guy who our friend is dating, offered to walk us over to the station - before they got their UBER ride down the block! We of course, had to walk past the creepy people again, on our way to the entrance. and some guy mocked us a bit. Eesh. We went down the escalator (at least the DOWN one worked) and saw two female police officers on guard. Then we saw them again, plus a male officer, while we waited about 5 minutes for out train. I was relieved to get out  of there. Our ride was bumpy, I don't recall the train every shaking so much in the 10 years we've lived here! Then, for extra fun, I had to worry again, because I had parked at MacArthur station - which I've avoided and had refused to ever go back to again, since a 19 year old girl was stabbed to death there recently (about two months ago?). Good times! AVOID the 16th Street BART station unless you MUST be there! Don't look at the vagrants hanging out, just walk fast and keep going. Better yet, stay HOME.\n",

But I was feeling confident and adventurous, so I looked up our destination and realized that we could get off on 16th St. Mission, then take a bus to our final destination. BIG mistake. The stop was dark and underground, as soon as we surfaced to street level- we realized our mistake. There was a protest going on across the street, men yelling at each other and aggressive people everywhere. We quickly oriented ourselves and got the heck out of there, and made sure we stayed on the BART until Powell for the remainder of our trip. The station was trashed and smelled of urine, overall did not feel safe. Would not recommend unless you are familiar with the neighborhood, and know where you are going.\n",

A young female like myself gets HARRASSED big time every step I take.  I am always very uncomfortable to I avoid it at all costs. SOmething needs to be done about that. If we didnt get stuck in a corner the second you came out of the station (or going in)  You could probably run through the crowd faster...  but instead you are cornered, away from the street and everyone puts their head down and runs through there so fast you are pretty much on your own.  Put your walking shoes on and take the next station instead.... and NEVER go there at night.  At the very least hold on to your pepper spray like I do if you cant avoid it.\n",

Maybe if we show some sympathy or collectively work to help the less fortunate it wouldn't be so bad. its true, Drugs are a serious problem in this area, from boujee pill popping hipsters to the corner crack addicts, everyone has their own issues..people pass judgment onto those that cant defend themselves. the homeless don't see the yelp review with a photo of them sleeping on the cold floor because rich people kicked them out their homes.. it really breaks my heart.

The station has one of those bike friendly rails where you can put the wheels in the slit and easily push it as you walk up and down the stairs. Lots of stairs and chances are you will run into a day where the escalator is out of order, forcing you to work out your legs. The urine smell is the worst out of all the stations. I know 24th Mission station has a similar stank but I haven't been there enough to tell you if it is on the same level or worse. As you are going up the escalator or walking up the stairs, it will hit and greet you. \n",

It is always filled with homeless people and - not only that - often aggressive homeless!  No problem shouting at you and urinating in front of you.  Nasty!   I'm continuously amazed that San Francisco as a City has not been able to figure out any way to clear up this area.  It's embarrassing when friends come to the city.   Please do something! Anything!\n",

I made the trip in from Oakland, to meet my hubby to meet friends for dinner. I knew that this station has always been unsavory, so I was hesitant to go back there. I was not happy to have to walk up the super long staircase, upon arrival, due to the escalator being out  of service. As expected, when I got to street level, I was instantly disgusted by lots of homeless guys (and maybe one gal) hanging out right there, just like I've seen before. My hubby was waiting for me a few steps away from them. Our dinner went a bit later than I thought it would, and thank god the muscular guy who our friend is dating, offered to walk us over to the station - before they got their UBER ride down the block! We of course, had to walk past the creepy people again, on our way to the entrance. and some guy mocked us a bit. Eesh. We went down the escalator (at least the DOWN one worked) and saw two female police officers on guard. Then we saw them again, plus a male officer, while we waited about 5 minutes for out train. I was relieved to get out  of there. Our ride was bumpy, I don't recall the train every shaking so much in the 10 years we've lived here! Then, for extra fun, I had to worry again, because I had parked at MacArthur station - which I've avoided and had refused to ever go back to again, since a 19 year old girl was stabbed to death there recently (about two months ago?). Good times! AVOID the 16th Street BART station unless you MUST be there! Don't look at the vagrants hanging out, just walk fast and keep going. Better yet, stay HOME.\n",

The stop was dark and underground, as soon as we surfaced to street level- we realized our mistake. There was a protest going on across the street, men yelling at each other and aggressive people everywhere. We quickly oriented ourselves and got the heck out of there, and made sure we stayed on the BART until Powell for the remainder of our trip.

The downside is that the platform to downtown is located in the middle of the block on San Jose Ave., between Geneva Ave. and Ocean Ave.  Another downside is that the last stop for the J & K are way closer to the Ocean Ave. side, although BART has since opened a dedicated gate on that side so folks don't need to walk all the way closer to the Geneva Ave. side of the station to enter to BART.

You have to navigate around narrow pathways and it is especially dangerous in one section where both the J & K makes a slight left turn next to a pathway that is maybe one foot wide because a pole stands in the way.

Anyways, my boyfriend lives a couple of blocks away from here and if we ever go downtown or to the Giants game, it's so convenient for us to come here cause it's cheaper and we don't have to pay for parking. Other than that, they should make an escalator where the stairs are at the end of the Bart Station where it leads you to where the buses are and where you can get picked/dropped off at. There's times when I come here with my luggage and I have to carry it down the stairs. FYI, my luggage seems to weigh a lot at times and by the time I get to the bottom of the stairs, I'm pooped.

No more street parking (limited to two hours) and the parking situation in the parking lot is insane. And the payment is equally insane, so I'm not crazy about it. I used to be able to find decent parking, but I'll say that it's better than driving over there, but not ideal. I now park at Del Norte, North Berkeley, or even Lake Merritt. But if I have to come here, I do. I just have to make sure that I get there hours early so that I can find parking and have time to walk the long 4-6 blocks to the station.\n",

The innards remind me of MacArthur Station's innards, which is never a good sign, but the final dropping of starrage comes not from any of that but from the fact that the platforms are on opposite sides of the tracks.  Yes, I realize that it's coming out of the Transbay Tube, so it makes more sense for the tracks to be as close together as they are, but there is enough lead distance, I believe, to have separated the tracks and put in place a central platform that services trains going in either direction.

I know from the statements of others that parking during the week gets packed, but from first hand experience if you desire to come here on a Saturday morning, give yourself time because it looks like Costco with people sharking to get a parking spot. Seriously, give yourself time. Otherwise you will have to find some place on the street that isn't permit or 2 hour parking to park your car, and the perimeter of the BART station has street cleaning on Saturday, and people do take the ticket if they are desperate.

The man in charge of the booth had left his post few seconds before I was robbed. That mugging looked as a coordinated action among the employee and the robbers. This man in charge of the booth had indicated me few minutes before the assault that the stop of the Bolt Bus with destiny to Angeles was at dark and secluded area behind the BART station. When I followed his instructions, the guys went after me, so I returned immediately to the Booth. Right immediately the man in charge left his post and the assault happened without regard of few bystanders. There was nobody there to help and call the police. The robbers never left the place, they stood there watching me and few seconds later tried to rob a young lady that started to yell and scared them off to a short distance. Finally, i saw my bus, ran to the Bolt bus stop which was located a block away on Seven St. Then, I checked in and departed to Los Angeles. Those guys took all my cash and scared the crap out of me.

The lot fills up fast, and has the steepest daily price tag of any BART station at $7. Unless you're a really early bird, you're more likely to end up parking in one of the (non-BART-affiliated) auxiliary lots, which cost even more - somewhere between $8 and $10 a day presently. That's starting to approach downtown SF parking prices, which makes you begin to wonder, why take BART at all?

Parking during the week is crazy expensive and not worth it. I think it's $5, but it could be more since prices are always going up with BART. I know from the statements of others that parking during the week gets packed, but from first hand experience if you desire to come here on a Saturday morning, give yourself time because it looks like Costco with people sharking to get a parking spot. Seriously, give yourself time. Otherwise you will have to find some place on the street that isn't permit or 2 hour parking to park your car, and the perimeter of the BART station has street cleaning on Saturday, and people do take the ticket if they are desperate. Parking is really the only negative I can find for this place.\n",

Now another thing to keep in mind the platform layout is a bit confusing.  Trains going back towards SF you need to go to the very lower level.  There are elevators that service this station to the street and to the platforms mind you they do smell of urine, but most major cities subway systems always seem to have this issue so this wasn't a shock to me.  Also several of the exits also escalators too so if you have luggage.  Bart gets the job done, although be sure to look and see where the final stop is versus looking at the color of the line as the maps on the trains allude to, the colors are meaningless as I found out on my return to the airport.\n",

Bart needs to massively improve its cleanliness and need to enforce non loitering. It seems that on a daily basis the seats and floors do not get wiped or mopped as you can still smell in the morning  and all day trace of all kinds of body fluids. Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.  I would pay a little bit more to make this happen.\n",

One best way to get a seat leaving the city is boarding the first car which dumps you here at the end of the station. The trouble is taking the stairs  downstairs being the farthest point of the station, occasionally the corner of stairs is used as emergency urinal. That is so Bart. News of similar events on the trains would not surprise any riders and why should this? Whatever. Third rate train service is best Bay Area has. Efficiency is all this and many stations have. That is C grade in academic terms. Bart is very good at meeting C grade standards. And their culture does not understand concepts like quality some may say. That would be B grade or above in academic terms. We know which portion of population are sought for Bart labor force. Anything above C graders will be complainers and no wonder D graders and F graders love to ride Bart for adventure and mayhem. Nobody above a C grade intellect would come near Bart UNLESS THEY HAVE TO. Bart also excels at not hearing anything but their own voice. Here is 12th Street as a typical Bart station. Average as it gets.\n",

      "  Review 61: This is one of the many original stations around when BART first opened back in September 1972.  Back in the days, instead of taking AC #51 to Berkeley from Downtown Oakland, I rode the BART to Downtown Berkeley from this station...much faster and less stops along the way (19th St., MacArthur, Ashby and, voila, Berkeley).  I also have ridden BART from this point to Downtown San Francisco.  I consider this \"subway\" station and the many bus routes above the \"boardwalk\" aka Broadway the transit hub of Downtown Oakland.  Heading to JLS?  This is the station to get off at, and one has a choice of catching the 72 or 72M (AC) or the Shuttle bus...which is cool.  City Center with the shops and restaurants and facing the Federal Building - 13th Street exit (westerly direction); Frank Ogawa Plaza, Tully's Coffee, City Hall and State Building - 14th Street exit (northerly and westerly direction); Oakland Chinatown, EBMUD - 11th Street exit and a two blocks walk in a southerly and easterly direction, respectively; and 12th, 13th and 14th Street exits (easterly direction) one will see Goodwill Industries, Burger King, DeLauer's bookstore, Rite Aid, etc., respectively.\n",

      "  Review 62: I not only use this station as traveling to and from San Francisco, Berkeley and/or El Cerrito, but also as a station where I can walk the passageway for a few blocks to get from 14th Street to 11th Street for a destination of either Oakland Chinatown or Farmer's Market on Fridays and back.  It makes me think of the song, Under the Boardwalk, by the Drifters...\"when the sun beats down upon the tar roof...and you wish your tired feet were fireproof...\" and there's an advantage to do so.   \"Heat wave\" hot or it's raining hard, use the passageway under Broadway (aka boardwalk) from City Center to Oakland Chinatown to avoid street and foot traffic - it's cool down there during the summer and warm (don't have to put up an umbrella) during the rainy season.    \n",

News of similar events on the trains would not surprise any riders and why should this? Whatever. Third rate train service is best Bay Area has. Efficiency is all this and many stations have. That is C grade in academic terms. Bart is very good at meeting C grade standards. And their culture does not understand concepts like quality some may say. That would be B grade or above in academic terms. We know which portion of population are sought for Bart labor force. Anything above C graders will be complainers and no wonder D graders and F graders love to ride Bart for adventure and mayhem.

      "  Review 191: This is one of the many original stations around when BART first opened back in September 1972.  Back in the days, instead of taking AC #51 to Berkeley from Downtown Oakland, I rode the BART to Downtown Berkeley from this station...much faster and less stops along the way (19th St., MacArthur, Ashby and, voila, Berkeley).  I also have ridden BART from this point to Downtown San Francisco.  I consider this \"subway\" station and the many bus routes above the \"boardwalk\" aka Broadway the transit hub of Downtown Oakland.  Heading to JLS?  This is the station to get off at, and one has a choice of catching the 72 or 72M (AC) or the Shuttle bus...which is cool.  City Center with the shops and restaurants and facing the Federal Building - 13th Street exit (westerly direction); Frank Ogawa Plaza, Tully's Coffee, City Hall and State Building - 14th Street exit (northerly and westerly direction); Oakland Chinatown, EBMUD - 11th Street exit and a two blocks walk in a southerly and easterly direction, respectively; and 12th, 13th and 14th Street exits (easterly direction) one will see Goodwill Industries, Burger King, DeLauer's bookstore, Rite Aid, etc., respectively.\n",

      "  Review 192: I not only use this station as traveling to and from San Francisco, Berkeley and/or El Cerrito, but also as a station where I can walk the passageway for a few blocks to get from 14th Street to 11th Street for a destination of either Oakland Chinatown or Farmer's Market on Fridays and back.  It makes me think of the song, Under the Boardwalk, by the Drifters...\"when the sun beats down upon the tar roof...and you wish your tired feet were fireproof...\" and there's an advantage to do so.   \"Heat wave\" hot or it's raining hard, use the passageway under Broadway (aka boardwalk) from City Center to Oakland Chinatown to avoid street and foot traffic - it's cool down there during the summer and warm (don't have to put up an umbrella) during the rainy season.    \n",

There are elevators that service this station to the street and to the platforms mind you they do smell of urine, but most major cities subway systems always seem to have this issue so this wasn't a shock to me.  Also several of the exits also escalators too so if you have luggage.  Bart gets the job done, although be sure to look and see where the final stop is versus looking at the color of the line as the maps on the trains allude to, the colors are meaningless as I found out on my return to the airport.\n",

Bart needs to massively improve its cleanliness and need to enforce non loitering. It seems that on a daily basis the seats and floors do not get wiped or mopped as you can still smell in the morning  and all day trace of all kinds of body fluids. Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.

As you can understand, I was very confused as to why I would not get my ticket back which had a remaining balance on it. The money on that card belonged to me. This BART agent continued to treat me very unprofessionally. The BART agent said that she should be charging me $5.25 for a lost ticket. My ticket was right there, in her hand! I told her repeatedly that I want my remaining balance and I didn't understand why she would not return the ticket, I did nothing wrong. She told me that she couldn't prove that I got on at Montgomery and continued to refuse to give me my ticket back.

Therefore, I should not be at fault for the machine's error. Her response was that I couldn't prove that the machine had messed up, that there is no record of where I was coming from. Although she couldn't prove either that I \"was lying\", this BART agent took it upon herself to make sure that the customer was at fault, to not give me the benefit of the doubt, thus making me pay the price for BART's mechanical problems. She said either I exit without my remaining balance or I pay the $5.25. She left me with no others options except to leave after several minutes of debate and continue this conversation with BART officials above her.\n",

      "  Review 89: When this has happened in the past, the agents have always taken fault for the mechanical problems of the entry and exit machines and would program that ticket or clipper card so that I could exit normally with the proper fare deducted. With the amount of crowds that come in and out of BART at rush hour, I imagine this sort of thing happens all the time. I am extremely offended that BART, a system which I choose to support and ride every day, is falsely accusing me of not paying my fare, and essentially stealing. I am let down by how this was handled and I am shocked that your employees would behave so unethically. I am not comfortable supporting a system which accuses it's paying customers of being dishonest. I put $140.00 on my clipper card every month, I am a loyal BART customer, and should not have to explain myself.\n",

      "  Review 97: This review is for service that occured on May 14, 2012 between 5-5:30pm at the 19th St. Bart Station. The worst help/service I've ever received from public transportation employees! I have a clipper card and it has been blocked due to theft on my autoload card. I had it unblocked on May 9th and Clipper's customer service told me it was ready for use but first needed to be \"picked up\" by tapping it on a \"ticket vending machine.\" I thought this was the \"add fare machine\" but apparently they are different. I go to a BART agent on the 20th St. side and he has no idea what what I am talking about. He tells me to call Clipper customer service again and let them know the situation. So this is my 2nd time calling and was on hold for 13 mins... that was the least of my problems. I had the representative on the phone to explain to the BART agent (on the 20th St. side)  and he kept saying sorry I don't know what that is. I eventually hung up with Clipper customer service. Since the Bart Agent had no idea, I figured he was a new employee. At least he was sincere about not knowing. I walked over to the 19th St. side BART agents and there were two of them! Great I figured someone should know what to do. A lady named Collette and an African American man were in the booth. Collette was sincere about the situation altough she didn't know what to do was still very understanding to the situation. But the African American man went off on me in a rather harsh tone because I tried to explain what Clipper customer service told me. He was short with me and interrupted me at every moment I tried to talk. I asked to speak to a manager and he said \"Pssshhh lease\" Im guessing that meant \"Please\" I guess he didn't finish grade school or something. He then yelled and cut off Collette because she tried to defend me by saying, \"I think she is right, she has to go to the Embarcadero Station to the Clipper customer service agent.\" He yelled at his own Co-worker!!! He kept sayiing \"I know about this and there is nothing we can do.\" He then went inside the booth and shut the door. Seriously?! I almost thought I was in elementary school. How childish was that? I seriously rethink of BART employees such as him as \"ignorant fools\" I thought agents were supposed to help you with problems such as these. I'm so glad I wasn't asking for directions. He might have told me to go Africa or something. *Sigh* really all I can say at this point is \"ignorance excuses no one.\" I should actually bring it up to BART management...*hint hint*\n",

I don't think the people who work here actually do anything but stare at you and read the paper, though. Some of the business people (I'm one of them) can be rude. I had to shove a guy out of my way who refused to move to the side when I was in a hurry and going up the escalator, this was AFTER I nicely asked, \"excuse me\" and he replied, \"you have to WAIT\" like some little bitch. Like hell I did! Other than that, a conveniently located station. I get in and out quickly. The trains run pretty often, too. I love when buskers play music inside (once was serenaded by a beautiful young man playing accordion...sigh) but that saxophone guy is a dick and territorial with others who have got there before him. I've seen him threaten violence so he can suck it and will never get a dime from me. I don't care how groovy a rift you play. Music and violent threats DO NOT go together, penishole. \n",

We were between the MacArthur Station and 19th Street, not yet underground but beneath the various freeway overpasses and such. There was a patch of grass, I am guessing around 27th Street. This patch of grass was bordered by the BART tracks, the freeway and some deserted street. On this patch of grass grew a tree, and underneath the shade of said anemic tree was what appeared to be a man. As the train got closer to this scene, I realized that it was, indeed, a man. And that the man was nude. Also, the man was on all fours. This was getting good. We got closer and I realized that the man was actually on all *threes*. Was this an amputee, I wondered?

First off, if you're headed towards Fremont at the end of a work day, the train is far less crowded than getting on at 12th St yet the fare down there is the same.  It's only a few extra blocks so take a walk to it.  Other factors include that there's a Subway Sandwich shop underground in the station (but outside the fare gates), that's a really cool idea and wish BART had more joint things like that.  There is also an underground connection to Sears as well although that's now closed unfortunately.  The station does everything 12th St does but does it a little quieter, therefore, my favorite.  The only knock is no cell service in downtown Oakland stations, unlike those in SF.  C'mon guys, upgrade!\n",

Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety.

      "  Review 211: This review is for service that occured on May 14, 2012 between 5-5:30pm at the 19th St. Bart Station. The worst help/service I've ever received from public transportation employees! I have a clipper card and it has been blocked due to theft on my autoload card. I had it unblocked on May 9th and Clipper's customer service told me it was ready for use but first needed to be \"picked up\" by tapping it on a \"ticket vending machine.\" I thought this was the \"add fare machine\" but apparently they are different. I go to a BART agent on the 20th St. side and he has no idea what what I am talking about. He tells me to call Clipper customer service again and let them know the situation. So this is my 2nd time calling and was on hold for 13 mins... that was the least of my problems. I had the representative on the phone to explain to the BART agent (on the 20th St. side)  and he kept saying sorry I don't know what that is. I eventually hung up with Clipper customer service. Since the Bart Agent had no idea, I figured he was a new employee. At least he was sincere about not knowing. I walked over to the 19th St. side BART agents and there were two of them! Great I figured someone should know what to do. A lady named Collette and an African American man were in the booth. Collette was sincere about the situation altough she didn't know what to do was still very understanding to the situation. But the African American man went off on me in a rather harsh tone because I tried to explain what Clipper customer service told me. He was short with me and interrupted me at every moment I tried to talk. I asked to speak to a manager and he said \"Pssshhh lease\" Im guessing that meant \"Please\" I guess he didn't finish grade school or something. He then yelled and cut off Collette because she tried to defend me by saying, \"I think she is right, she has to go to the Embarcadero Station to the Clipper customer service agent.\" He yelled at his own Co-worker!!! He kept sayiing \"I know about this and there is nothing we can do.\" He then went inside the booth and shut the door. Seriously?! I almost thought I was in elementary school. How childish was that? I seriously rethink of BART employees such as him as \"ignorant fools\" I thought agents were supposed to help you with problems such as these. I'm so glad I wasn't asking for directions. He might have told me to go Africa or something. *Sigh* really all I can say at this point is \"ignorance excuses no one.\" I should actually bring it up to BART management...*hint hint*\n",

I was gazing out the window, contemplating whether seagulls missed the 70s or not. We were between the MacArthur Station and 19th Street, not yet underground but beneath the various freeway overpasses and such. There was a patch of grass, I am guessing around 27th Street. This patch of grass was bordered by the BART tracks, the freeway and some deserted street. On this patch of grass grew a tree, and underneath the shade of said anemic tree was what appeared to be a man. As the train got closer to this scene, I realized that it was, indeed, a man. And that the man was nude. Also, the man was on all fours. This was getting good. We got closer and I realized that the man was actually on all *threes*. Was this an amputee, I wondered? Had he lost an arm in an agricultural accident? Nope, for as the train inched past the guy I realized that his hand was behind him....and that he was reaching around...and placing what appeared to be...\n",

First off, if you're headed towards Fremont at the end of a work day, the train is far less crowded than getting on at 12th St yet the fare down there is the same.  It's only a few extra blocks so take a walk to it.  Other factors include that there's a Subway Sandwich shop underground in the station (but outside the fare gates), that's a really cool idea and wish BART had more joint things like that.  There is also an underground connection to Sears as well although that's now closed unfortunately.  The station does everything 12th St does but does it a little quieter, therefore, my favorite.  The only knock is no cell service in downtown Oakland stations, unlike those in SF.  C'mon guys, upgrade!\n",

I put $7.10 on my ticket, the exact fare to get from Rockridge to Montgomery and back ($3.55 per way). I got to work in the morning as usual. During the evening commute, however, there were some complications. I entered at New Montgomery and Market. Once I arrived at the BART gates at 4:32pm (plus or minus 1 minute), I put my paper ticket through the entrance machine, waited for the ticket to pop up, and the gates to open. I grabbed my ticket after what had seemed like a normal entry process. I boarded the Concord train, which came at 4:40pm. I decided to get off at 19th Street Station, rather than Rockridge, as I needed to run an errand downtown before returning home.  Exiting at 19th Street would leave me with .40 cents remaining on my card ($3.55 minus $3.15).\n",

I proceeded to the agent's box and handed her my ticket. First she asked where I was coming from and I told her Montgomery. The BART agent said that I could simply exit out the side door, but forgot to hand me my ticket back.  I responded, \"What about my ticket?\". She told me that she would not return my ticket to me. As you can understand, I was very confused as to why I would not get my ticket back which had a remaining balance on it. The money on that card belonged to me. This BART agent continued to treat me very unprofessionally. The BART agent said that she should be charging me $5.25 for a lost ticket. My ticket was right there, in her hand! I told her repeatedly that I want my remaining balance and I didn't understand why she would not return the ticket, I did nothing wrong. She told me that she couldn't prove that I got on at Montgomery and continued to refuse to give me my ticket back. I repeatedly told this agent that I put my ticket in the machine at Montgomery, it came out of the top of the machine, but obviously didn't properly record where I was. Therefore, I should not be at fault for the machine's error. Her response was that I couldn't prove that the machine had messed up, that there is no record of where I was coming from. Although she couldn't prove either that I \"was lying\", this BART agent took it upon herself to make sure that the customer was at fault, to not give me the benefit of the doubt, thus making me pay the price for BART's mechanical problems. She said either I exit without my remaining balance or I pay the $5.25. She left me with no others options except to leave after several minutes of debate and continue this conversation with BART officials above her.\n",

Parking at Rockridge is now nearly impossible on the street, since the city of Oakland has made what remaining streets that were formerly non-permitted within a 6-block area require a 4-hour permit. BART's lot fills by 7:30 am, so anyone who needs to drop off kids at school before heading off on their commute is out of luck, unless they want to pay $6/day for one of the few 10am spots--that go largely unused until they become regular $3 spots at 10 am, when they immediately fill. Who can afford that every day, or wait until 10 to go to work? I'm now driving in after doing an analysis of all the other options. Goodbye BART, after riding for 15 years, I'm not sad to no longer be stuck in a packed train like a sardine anymore, especially since delays breakdowns that were once rare are now almost a daily occurrence. The station is filthy too, as well as the bathroom. I saw a mess on the stairs marked with a cone for 4 days before it was cleaned up.\n",

      "  Review 240: Ok. Most evenings, when I get off Bart at Rockridge, there is a saxophone player there, squawking and bleating with a-tonal fervor. I normally love music. And I generally can block out bad music. But the sax player at Rockridge Bart in the evenings on weekdays is so deplorable, so deliberately and hideously foul, so without restraint intentionally awful, that I am finally compelled to yelp. I may never enter an other yelp. This may be my sole contribution to the yelp-o-sphere. No doubt many will disagree. And I accept that. No doubt it is in poor form, to review a street performer scraping change from the evening commute. No doubt this is completely subjective! And that some may truly like the screeches and blats and fingernail on chalkboard dying cat, horse in agony, truck wreck brake failure bridge collapse noises this man coaxes from his unhappy horn. Perhaps it is his artistic goal, to vex and trouble anyone within earshot, to give them a lesson in the complete absence of pleasantness, with an anti-musical hell bent assault on the very possibility of rhythm or melody, a rejection of all musical convention, like so many jazz students do before they realize it'll never get them laid, a putrid wallowing in the unnecessary, music as prank, as bratty insult, and if, if so, he is successful. I just had to go on record, once and for all, and howl into the wilderness, I DON'T LIKE IT!  There. I feel better. Thank you.\n",

Fruitvale was the next stop, so I switched trains here.\n",

      "  Review 48: Fruitvale station is an elevated, above-ground station. It's a pretty basic BART station with two platforms (side platforms), one for north/westbound trains heading into San Francisco and another heading south/eastbound towards Oakland Coliseum and Oracle Arena (next stop), home of the 2014-15 defending NBA world champion Golden State Warriors. I switched platforms and, while waiting for the next north/eastbound train, hung out with other waiting riders looking over the ledge of the platform. What I saw was a relatively nice looking, small, mixed-use development called Fruitvale Village.\n",

There are chains like Papa John's and Subway, lots of Hispanic restaurants (e.g. taquerias, tortas) and some Asian (e.g. Chinese, Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches) places.

At the time, all I remembered about the movie was that it was critically acclaimed. I never got around to watching it. It turns out the movie is named after this very BART station, based on a shooting that occurred here in 2009. The movie was written and directed by Ryan Coogler, who is from Oakland and who also wrote and directed the seventh Rocky film Creed (2015). I loved Creed, so now I want to see Fruitvale Station. Along with having the same writer and director, both movies also have the same star: Michael B. Jordan. Fruitvale Station was filmed here as well.\n",

They basically went to buy tickets, when this guy steps in front of them and says let me show you how to buy tickets (you could tell they didn't really need help).  After they ge their tickets, the con man  asks each of them for money, so they each gave him a couple of dollars.  When they pulled out their wallets the guy points out the fact that they had more money to give and asks them to cough up some more cash.  In the end he walked away with about $25.

But the bike lockers are in a dimly lite area. Access to AC transit is good but rarely can you make a connection between BART and a bus without waiting a while. Its best to have your money in hand if your using the ticket machines. If you stand there and fumble around youll be bait for the panhandlers and scammers. Using a clipper card gets you through this station and on your way. I strongly recommend getting one if you use this station a lot. There are some entertaining characters like the hallelujah guy,and the always sober church ladies handing watch tower flyers. The flea market is pretty cool and the guy selling bootleg CDs always has some awesome soul music cranked up to set a mood. The best mexican food truck in the area is  located on the corner of fruitvale and E14th street. There are open art studios and Ale Industries brewery located a block away on E11th . From this station your a nice bike trip away from the estuary shoreline, Oakland Rivera and Alameda. Parking is plentiful but fills up fast. Ive never had my vehicle busted into..knock..knock but i will repeat this..do not leave ANYTHING of value in your car whether your parking in or around the station on the surface streets. This is still a urban area so keep your guard up and youll be fine. Have fun and be SAFE.\n",

      "  Review 173: In the ghetto... Yes I am a white girl and yes I live in East Oakland, and yes sometimes I walk home (it's about a 10 minute walk) from the Fruitvale Bart station.... after the incident I witnessed tonight I will think twice... It all went down at about 8:05 pm.... I had just stepped off the steep ass escalator and was about halfway to the exit when screams broke out.... I bolted for the exit and once safely outside watched to see the drama unfold...I turned around to see a woman screaming,\"grab him, stop him\".... Next thing I see is a guy grabs the man she is yelling about and holds on to him.... My eyes shift to the group of people surrounding the bottom of the elevator.... There is a woman laying there.... The woman who had been yelling grab him, started beating on the glass where the Bart employee stands asking her to call the police, call for help....The Bart employee stared at her blankly and the lady started screaming, \"do you speak English? Call someone for help....  That woman was just pushed down the escalator\"..... At this point I called 911 and was promptly told by a recording that all operators were busy..... Wow!!! That gives me a nice sense of safety! After 2 minutes the line picked up  and I told the operator I was at the Fruitvale Bart station, which at that point I was transferred to Bart police..... The police showed up moments later... and quickly handcuffed the woman who had been yelling!?!... Umm she's the one that was helping the victim (she was uncuffed about 5 minutes later) .... The man who had pushed the woman was also cuffed and asked to sit on a bench... At this point one of the officers went over to escalator to check on the woman that had been pushed... The other officer was talking to the man who had grabbed the \"bad guy\"..... At this point the \"bad guy\" tried to run and ran into a garbage can and fell to the ground... the cop ran over grabbed him up and he was ushered to the back of the police car.... At this point the fire department came and the lady at the bottom of the escalator was brought to her feet.... After gawking for about 15 minutes, calling my BF and having him come and gawk for another 5 minutes... I left the Bart station and put buy mace on my to do list..... 2 stars for the better then the new 90210 drama....\n",

When they pulled out their wallets the guy points out the fact that they had more money to give and asks them to cough up some more cash.  In the end he walked away with about $25.

      "  Review 188: My love and hate relationship with this station has been on going since i moved here in 01'. The bike valet and bike link lockers are great. But the bike lockers are in a dimly lite area. Access to AC transit is good but rarely can you make a connection between BART and a bus without waiting a while. Its best to have your money in hand if your using the ticket machines. If you stand there and fumble around youll be bait for the panhandlers and scammers. Using a clipper card gets you through this station and on your way. I strongly recommend getting one if you use this station a lot. There are some entertaining characters like the hallelujah guy,and the always sober church ladies handing watch tower flyers. The flea market is pretty cool and the guy selling bootleg CDs always has some awesome soul music cranked up to set a mood. The best mexican food truck in the area is  located on the corner of fruitvale and E14th street. There are open art studios and Ale Industries brewery located a block away on E11th . From this station your a nice bike trip away from the estuary shoreline, Oakland Rivera and Alameda. Parking is plentiful but fills up fast. Ive never had my vehicle busted into..knock..knock but i will repeat this..do not leave ANYTHING of value in your car whether your parking in or around the station on the surface streets. This is still a urban area so keep your guard up and youll be fine. Have fun and be SAFE.\n",

Yes I am a white girl and yes I live in East Oakland, and yes sometimes I walk home (it's about a 10 minute walk) from the Fruitvale Bart station.... after the incident I witnessed tonight I will think twice... It all went down at about 8:05 pm.... I had just stepped off the steep ass escalator and was about halfway to the exit when screams broke out.... I bolted for the exit and once safely outside watched to see the drama unfold...I turned around to see a woman screaming,\"grab him, stop him\".... Next thing I see is a guy grabs the man she is yelling about and holds on to him.... My eyes shift to the group of people surrounding the bottom of the elevator.... There is a woman laying there.... The woman who had been yelling grab him, started beating on the glass where the Bart employee stands asking her to call the police, call for help....The Bart employee stared at her blankly and the lady started screaming, \"do you speak English? Call someone for help....  That woman was just pushed down the escalator\"..... At this point I called 911 and was promptly told by a recording that all operators were busy..... Wow!!! That gives me a nice sense of safety! After 2 minutes the line picked up  and I told the operator I was at the Fruitvale Bart station, which at that point I was transferred to Bart police..... The police showed up moments later... and quickly handcuffed the woman who had been yelling!?!... Umm she's the one that was helping the victim (she was uncuffed about 5 minutes later) .... The man who had pushed the woman was also cuffed and asked to sit on a bench... At this point one of the officers went over to escalator to check on the woman that had been pushed... The other officer was talking to the man who had grabbed the \"bad guy\"..... At this point the \"bad guy\" tried to run and ran into a garbage can and fell to the ground... the cop ran over grabbed him up and he was ushered to the back of the police car.... At this point the fire department came and the lady at the bottom of the escalator was brought to her feet.... After gawking for about 15 minutes, calling my BF and having him come and gawk for another 5 minutes... I left the Bart station and put buy mace on my to do list..... 2 stars for the better then the new 90210 drama....\n",

      "  Review 40: I waited in line to exchange a few tickets, the person being helped had a complex issue resulting in a line of about 5 people forming behind me. To her credit the woman staffing the window called for someone to help with us customers. As the next person in line I thought great u can take care of my exchange and still make my train. However, B. Lopez apparently decided that the time of everyone in the line behind me was more important than mine. As she told me that she was going to sell them tickets before exchanging mine. I objected to this as I knew all of us wouldn't be helped before my train arrived, and maybe I'm being obtuse but I thought the point of a line was to help people in the order they arrived. It seems to me that if someone wasn't going to be helped it wouldn't be the person who'd been waiting the longest.... Again maybe I just don't know how lines work, but I'm pretty sure I understand the concept of lines. At a time when bart is complaining of falling ridership I don't understand why you hire employees who go out of there way to chase away loyal customers who've been riding bart for over 20 yrs. Being that my commute is the same whether I drive or bart it'll be a long time before I ride bart again. Since my time apparently means less than the time of others... Thanks but no thanks bart... maybe one day we'll all get fed up and execute a bart boycott, at least a brief one.

      "  Review 65: This is a review for the whole Bart. Bart has wonderful front office staff always. Bart is great because of its accessibility and parking as well schedule. Bart needs to massively improve its cleanliness and need to enforce non loitering. It seems that on a daily basis the seats and floors do not get wiped or mopped as you can still smell in the morning  and all day trace of all kinds of body fluids. Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.  I would pay a little bit more to make this happen.\n",

Just useless. I like Bart and rely on it but it should be ready for situations like this.\n",

But being from L.A. even if there had been some, and it was'nt a hot lazy Sunday, I doubt it would have topped anything I have even seen down home. So we hop in the train at this station not far from where my friend Kevin grew up. The train was powerful, long and proud as it arrived. It was packed inside due to the Gay Pride Event in San Francisco. It took off so fast, almost throwing us to the floor! I wanted to rate it 5 stars but the air was'nt working and we all got hot and sweaty together whether we wanted to or not. Lol But all in all I was in awe of the world famous Bay Area Rapid Transit system. And I am probably not the first or last to say, just seeing it is not enough.\n",

      "  Review 136: Before today, I had always enjoyed the Lake Merritt BART Station.  I had never been above ground here, though, or anywhere but the platform.  The platform deserves four and maybe even five stars for its calmness, quiet, and lack of pushy commuters.  When East Bay-bound BART trains used to be more unreliable, I would sometimes hop a Dublin/Pleasanton or Fremont train from Civic Center in the hope that I could catch a Richmond train from Lake Merritt and get to Berkeley quicker than waiting for a direct Richmond train.  It worked out maybe a third of the time, but like I already mentioned, this platform is a nice place to wait, and no one seems to know that the first car is the best car, so I was usually sitting pretty--literally.\n",

A former coworker and I fought off other pissed-off would-be passengers and caught a taxi to the Lake Merritt Station, which we correctly assumed would be up and running because it's on a different branch of BART from the Richmond and Pittsburg/Bay Point lines.

It should be called the Chinatown Station, because that's where it is.  It seems like a sketchfest above ground, but that's not why I'm raining on its star parade.  No, that would be because its first level is designed very poorly.  From where we entered, we couldn't get to the station agent's window.  We wanted to talk to the station agent to explain to him that we couldn't tag our Clipper cards here because we had already tagged them in Berkeley without actually riding the train.  But it's impossible to get to the station agent's window from the north entrance; you have to go upstairs and come back down through the south entrance.  That's dumb, so we went through the emergency exit and waited to talk to him when we realized that we could just board the train since we had already tagged our Clipper cards.  So not only is it designed poorly, but this station's poor design encourages fare evasion.\n",

The station floor is below ground so is cool or cold given the season. The architecture is nice because ceiling is high and has Windows unlike most Barts.  It is clean too. One time I was here and a lady cop was writing a ticket for this tall crazy looking guy and every few seconds the guy would take a step forward and she would have to take a step back to maintain her distance. It was disturbing a few passengers had to stick around just in case. I saw several Bart uniform employees waiting for a train. I walked and told them.  One of them peeked and said she has a gun. She can shoot him. They refused to go. I think that is Bart spirit for you in a not-nice area.

The subway stations in NYC are by far smellier and dirtier than any BART station I've been in.  I don't think I've seen so much as a mouse in the Lake Merrit BART, but go to almost any subway station in NYC or Boston and you're sure to see large rats on the tracks.  In comparison, the Lake Merritt BART is pristine!\n",

Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety.

But being from L.A. even if there had been some, and it was'nt a hot lazy Sunday, I doubt it would have topped anything I have even seen down home. So we hop in the train at this station not far from where my friend Kevin grew up. The train was powerful, long and proud as it arrived. It was packed inside due to the Gay Pride Event in San Francisco. It took off so fast, almost throwing us to the floor! I wanted to rate it 5 stars but the air was'nt working and we all got hot and sweaty together whether we wanted to or not.

No, that would be because its first level is designed very poorly.  From where we entered, we couldn't get to the station agent's window.  We wanted to talk to the station agent to explain to him that we couldn't tag our Clipper cards here because we had already tagged them in Berkeley without actually riding the train.  But it's impossible to get to the station agent's window from the north entrance; you have to go upstairs and come back down through the south entrance.  That's dumb, so we went through the emergency exit and waited to talk to him when we realized that we could just board the train since we had already tagged our Clipper cards.  So not only is it designed poorly, but this station's poor design encourages fare evasion.\n",

Because if you got yourself a job that you have to commute to at those hours, then you're set up and doing pretty well in the Bay Area these days, what, with the super high unemployment rates.

I don't know if the rest rooms work, never tried them. The elevator does not sneak you in or out. You have two sides you can take the escalator or elevator out of.

      "  Review 491: I waited in line to exchange a few tickets, the person being helped had a complex issue resulting in a line of about 5 people forming behind me. To her credit the woman staffing the window called for someone to help with us customers. As the next person in line I thought great u can take care of my exchange and still make my train. However, B. Lopez apparently decided that the time of everyone in the line behind me was more important than mine. As she told me that she was going to sell them tickets before exchanging mine. I objected to this as I knew all of us wouldn't be helped before my train arrived, and maybe I'm being obtuse but I thought the point of a line was to help people in the order they arrived. It seems to me that if someone wasn't going to be helped it wouldn't be the person who'd been waiting the longest.... Again maybe I just don't know how lines work, but I'm pretty sure I understand the concept of lines. At a time when bart is complaining of falling ridership I don't understand why you hire employees who go out of there way to chase away loyal customers who've been riding bart for over 20 yrs. Being that my commute is the same whether I drive or bart it'll be a long time before I ride bart again. Since my time apparently means less than the time of others... Thanks but no thanks bart... maybe one day we'll all get fed up and execute a bart boycott, at least a brief one.
