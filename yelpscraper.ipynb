       "  'Embarcadero Bart is nicer than most other San Francisco stations but I still have a few grievances against Embarcadero. First is that maintenance never seems to make any progress with the escalators. I\\'ve been commuting into this station for over a year now and I believe there\\'s been more days when the escalators have been \"under construction\" than it has been usable.  This creates a huge jam both getting on the platform and getting out of the station.  With people lugging around bulky luggage, strollers and bicycles, it becomes almost a safety problem.

Fortunately they have a Union and I am on the Transbay bus because we have a hostage situation also known as a strike. Let's see how long the hostages last before they freak out under stress of alternate commutes. Dependency sucks and has been the secret of American business. British invented it in colonies. They gave free narcotics like opium to gullible peasants to smoke and bought back the consumed opium which itself sells as another narcotic. Once they were opium addicts the opium was not free any more and the price of derivative narcotic dropped like a brick. We never hear such tales. We get bombarded by tales of WWII and those terrible Germans and terrible terrible and terrible terrible. British hold the world trophy for evil international and we deem them Civilized Nation Number One. Dependency has worked for riches effectively. It is blended into culture. Ever heard of iPhone? Bart knows a piece of action is available and boy it has to be big or they won't take it. What if not given up easy? That is fine. They hold the users hostage. No fix for you till we get OUR price. I hear future may lack a Bart but instead have Bay Area Rapid Cargo Service. Some in Sacramento deem Bart as a junk form of people treated as cargo transport. If Bart becomes a rapid 24/7 cargo service, there is a million+ vehicle trips off our roads annually and so much improvement in business transports while local bus services have to upgrade and not only have riders to have revenues but also can give more service more often. All we have to do is get rid of hostage takers like Bart Unions or pushers that own street corners and we are done. It is so much easier said than done. Evil is too natural and common in this hybrid version of British exploitation system. Evil is great and knows what it IAS doing. Fortunately and unfortunately. 18 Oct 2013\",\n",

I mean you figure that the elevator at Montgomery St is used a minimum of 100 times a day (I asked an employee of Bart). A permit is issued each year, good until a year from the date posted because at 100 rides a day times 365 days you get a minimum of 36,500 rides per year.

This lady has her small child with her everyday? You would expect social services to do something for the sake of the kids health. I'm not no snitch but if you can't take care of your kid give it a better life by allowing him/her to enter an adoption home. Using a kid as a pawn pisses me off since it's every damn day.

First is that maintenance never seems to make any progress with the escalators. I've been commuting into this station for over a year now and I believe there's been more days when the escalators have been \"under construction\" than it has been usable.  This creates a huge jam both getting on the platform and getting out of the station.  With people lugging around bulky luggage, strollers and bicycles, it becomes almost a safety problem.  Even worse, there are people that are completely unable to walk down the stairs and must wait in a long line to use the elevator.  Another problem is that when the elevators are actually working, they're going in the opposite direction of traffic (i.e. there are two people needing to get off the platform at 5pm after work and closer to 50 people trying to get on the platform).  Hopefully the elevator situation will be fixed soon to alleviate the barrage of people scrambling to make their train.\n",

This lady has her small child with her everyday? You would expect social services to do something for the sake of the kids health. I'm not no snitch but if you can't take care of your kid give it a better life by allowing him/her to enter an adoption home. Using a kid as a pawn pisses me off since it's every damn day.

First is that maintenance never seems to make any progress with the escalators. I've been commuting into this station for over a year now and I believe there's been more days when the escalators have been \"under construction\" than it has been usable.  This creates a huge jam both getting on the platform and getting out of the station.  With people lugging around bulky luggage, strollers and bicycles, it becomes almost a safety problem.  Even worse, there are people that are completely unable to walk down the stairs and must wait in a long line to use the elevator.  Another problem is that when the elevators are actually working, they're going in the opposite direction of traffic (i.e. there are two people needing to get off the platform at 5pm after work and closer to 50 people trying to get on the platform).  Hopefully the elevator situation will be fixed soon to alleviate the barrage of people scrambling to make their train.\n",

      "  Review 438: This is one of the better Bart stations. It is really good. You never feel you are descending down to a subway tunnel/nuclear war shelter deep below as in DC, etc. Some Bart stations need you to descend a lot and has never stopped bugging me after so long. Bart is on strike. They are underpaid at $71000 or $75000 average salary whichever figure you believe and $11000 average OT is not what some of us want and so on. Fortunately they have a Union and I am on the Transbay bus because we have a hostage situation also known as a strike. Let's see how long the hostages last before they freak out under stress of alternate commutes. Dependency sucks and has been the secret of American business. British invented it in colonies. They gave free narcotics like opium to gullible peasants to smoke and bought back the consumed opium which itself sells as another narcotic. Once they were opium addicts the opium was not free any more and the price of derivative narcotic dropped like a brick. We never hear such tales. We get bombarded by tales of WWII and those terrible Germans and terrible terrible and terrible terrible. British hold the world trophy for evil international and we deem them Civilized Nation Number One. Dependency has worked for riches effectively. It is blended into culture. Ever heard of iPhone? Bart knows a piece of action is available and boy it has to be big or they won't take it. What if not given up easy? That is fine. They hold the users hostage. No fix for you till we get OUR price. I hear future may lack a Bart but instead have Bay Area Rapid Cargo Service. Some in Sacramento deem Bart as a junk form of people treated as cargo transport. If Bart becomes a rapid 24/7 cargo service, there is a million+ vehicle trips off our roads annually and so much improvement in business transports while local bus services have to upgrade and not only have riders to have revenues but also can give more service more often. All we have to do is get rid of hostage takers like Bart Unions or pushers that own street corners and we are done. It is so much easier said than done. Evil is too natural and common in this hybrid version of British exploitation system. Evil is great and knows what it IAS doing. Fortunately and unfortunately. 18 Oct 2013\n",

But the result is that every single Bay Area resident convenes on one small service area for a multitude of questions.  Did your card lose its magnetization?  Prepare to spend at least two to three half-hour visits to this station to get it fixed.  (That is, unless you just give up and buy a new card.)  Awful, awful, awful!

Also available at this station is Muni Buses, which will take you deep into the city of SF/parts of Daly City etc...  This is a pretty huge station, about 2 SF blocks long.  If you're a SF native, you def know how long a block is!! LOL.  As a daily commuter,  I do enter and exit this station (M-F).  Luckily traveling from Fremont, Embarcadero is my stop coming to work every morning (M-F).  It's not as clean as we would like it to be, but its SF... the whole city needs a little cleaning!! =) Staircase smells like piss.. escalators are always out of service, elevators always going under construction (which causes the staircases to be congested), never a formal line, people always trying to hop in a train car when its super full, and don't care if the door jams.  In which case I hate, because then you hear the attendant yelling over the intercom \"THE TRAIN IS FULL, THERE WILL BE ANOTHER XXX Train in 3 min, DOORS ARE CLOSING **ding\" LOL.  And delays the whole Bart system.  Which is a lie! The next train comes in 15 minutes! LOL.  (this is assuming you are taking the Fremont Line).  \n",

Typically this is convenient for SF Giants fans coming in to attend one of the home games.  In which case, this station can get super crowded, and at that time be prepared to miss at least (2) trains before you can hop on one that is \"almost\" full when heading home.  I'd advise to take any of the outbound trains going towards Daly City/Millbrae or SF Airport.  And get off at the previous station Montgomery or Powell.  You will def catch a less full train car at either station.  For the most part, BART is just super convenient and inexpensive compared to Cal Train.\n",

Then both rows simultaenously step back into line, allowing people to line up in the order they were in originally (minus the people who boarded). Unfortunately, there are a few tourists and crackheads who don't know the unwritten etiquette who will storm the train in front of you.

At peak times, this station is not one to be at but it's to be expected. The MUNI side is pretty similar but with more crowding and noise. The service agent at the fare gate tends to be really grouchy, in general so watch out. This is the best place to board if you are heading outbound on the MUNI metro system and really inching for that specific seat that faces forward; you would have to fight the crowd in an orderly fashion though. Good luck with that. Use Translink if you have it, saves time at the gate and with fare inspectors.\n",

I forgot it in a bart in Richmond and I didn't realize until I got back to the city that I left it on the bart. I was worried and scared because the first thing that popped in my head is that someone took it. First thing I did was to talk to someone at the bart station and Christina from the Montgomery Bart Station worked her magic and managed to locate my bag with the help of a lady named Ray from the Warms Springs bart station! Thank you Christina! Christina really came through for me. She was professional and very knowledgeable and she has a beautiful heart because she saved me a lot of money for sure. Thank you Christina of the Montgomery Bart Station! I appreciate you and forever will be grateful. She also called a day later to check and see if I got my bag which to me is great customer service! Nothing was taken from my bag! I was able to track my bag because of my fully charged AirPods so that helped a lot with tracking where and which bart station my bag was at. Thank you again to Christina! You the best girl!\n",

I have been using this station since the late 1980's and it has been one of my favorite stations. It is the closest station to my home in North Beach and is within walking distance for me. There are also some stores near the station that I shop at fairly frequently, such as Target Express, CVS, and a 7 Eleven. Too bad the nearby Diaso recently closed. Caffe Bianco, where I used to work as a supervisor, is also near this station. I forgot to mention that there is also a See's Candies, Bank of America, Patrick & Co and a McDonald's nearby. This station is fairly clean and I rarely have any problems with any of the machines or encounter any \"unusual\" or hostile persons.\n",

It may take a few days to come, so it may be wise to have smaller bills of cash prepared to pay for the individual stalls in the traditional fashion until the hang tag arrives.

The signage on BART is some of the worst and most confusing of any public transit, in my opinion. Several trains on the same track, no sins on the trains themselves so you have to look at the flashing sign and you have to be pretty well versed with the train lines to be sure you're getting on the right one, and you have to decide quickly. Also, the cost these days is about the same to over a third of the cost of a Lyft ride. They need to make it as convenient as Lyft if they want to continue to compete.\n",

The problem with the Montgomery station is that things don't always work, which just adds to the lines and crowds. Not all the ticket scanners have functioning Clipper card scanners, in addition, the gates don't follow the flow of people either trying to get out of or into the station which further increases the lines. For example, during the morning commute 3 of 6 gates on the Market 500 exit allow people to exit, but only 2 allow Clipper cards?! I mean, given the flow of people there should be like 4-5 of 6 gates allowing for exit, that would help cut down on lines of people.

But I kept looking and looking and couldn't find the damn thing to put the cash in.  Okay then.  I thought I could wait until I get to the station and pay it as I leave.  I got off the train at the Montgomery Street station, three very mean looking station agents wearing yellow vests were screaming at the passengers and stopping them as they were exiting to check their clipper card and receipt.  One of the a**hole stopped me and I tried to explain to him that it was my first time taking the streetcar and wasn't familiar with the system.  A**hole asked me for my drivers license and started writing me a ticket for evasion of bus fare.  WTF!  The A**hole has no consideration whatsoever for those of us who had been so stressed out over the Bart strike.  These station people obviously got nothing better to do but to harass innocent people.

First thing I did was to talk to someone at the bart station and Christina from the Montgomery Bart Station worked her magic and managed to locate my bag with the help of a lady named Ray from the Warms Springs bart station! Thank you Christina! Christina really came through for me. She was professional and very knowledgeable and she has a beautiful heart because she saved me a lot of money for sure. Thank you Christina of the Montgomery Bart Station! I appreciate you and forever will be grateful. She also called a day later to check and see if I got my bag which to me is great customer service!

The signage on BART is some of the worst and most confusing of any public transit, in my opinion. Several trains on the same track, no sins on the trains themselves so you have to look at the flashing sign and you have to be pretty well versed with the train lines to be sure you're getting on the right one, and you have to decide quickly. Also, the cost these days is about the same to over a third of the cost of a Lyft ride. They need to make it as convenient as Lyft if they want to continue to compete.\n",

During the commute hours it gets so crowded, granted it's the financial district so a majority of the people who work down town get on and off there. The problem with the Montgomery station is that things don't always work, which just adds to the lines and crowds. Not all the ticket scanners have functioning Clipper card scanners, in addition, the gates don't follow the flow of people either trying to get out of or into the station which further increases the lines. For example, during the morning commute 3 of 6 gates on the Market 500 exit allow people to exit, but only 2 allow Clipper cards?! I mean, given the flow of people there should be like 4-5 of 6 gates allowing for exit, that would help cut down on lines of people.

It may take a few days to come, so it may be wise to have smaller bills of cash prepared to pay for the individual stalls in the traditional fashion until the hang tag arrives.

The concept of the double-line is lost at Powell, and riders seem to prefer snaking around the station in ridiculous weaves.

For whatever reason I happened to look at the permit all elevators have to post so that the riders know it's safe. I mean you figure that the elevator at Montgomery St is used a minimum of 100 times a day (I asked an employee of Bart). A permit is issued each year, good until a year from the date posted because at 100 rides a day times 365 days you get a minimum of 36,500 rides per year.

She had them to a system wide page and she called ahead to the next BART station to see if anyone had returned it. No one had but she told me to check in an hour or so because that's how long it usually takes for stuff to show up. She seemed pretty optimistic so I was equally sanguine. I came back in an hour and talked to a different woman named Keeta (sp?), who also did a page and called to the other stations to see if they had found it. I think she must called about 3 of them before giving me the good news that someone had turned it in AND it had all my stuff in it. (Maybe I should review the good people of SF next.) Anyway she gave me a roundtrip ticket to pick my wallet up in Lake Merritt and the Lake Merritt BART woman was also very nice.

The concourse is expansive with new ceilings and was clean, a rare thing in a BART station. I felt completely safe navigating the concourse. The platforms are not as well lit with inadequate seating. The concourse connects directly to the mall nearby. In my opinion, it's the best subway station in Downtown. I can't wait for the Central Subway line to open, which will provide a third subway connection here.\n",

      "  Review 41: This is for how it was pre-COVID, and I love this BART location! I've had nothing but terrific experiences, both getting off here and getting on--super convenient, dropping me off centrally in the city. I know people complain all the time about how it's dirty and expensive, but frankly, I don't see it. Maybe my standards are low or maybe I don't expect as much or maybe I'm just so freakin grateful I have this service. The ride I love, because unlike Caltrain which is bumpy and noisy, BART is smooth and gliding. I also love that there's an announcer--is it automated or an actual person? But whatever it is, it actually announces your stop every step of the way. It takes me all the way from the peninsula to the city! It's fairly clean inside and you can choose wherever you want to sit. For someone who's as spatially challenged as I am, the organization and layout of this station is fantastic--clear signs everywhere--exits and signs to further destinations clearly marked. no confusion whatsoever. This is a testimony to whomever designed it because I usually get lost wherever I go, but did I ever get lost, even my first time there? No! So I'm happy and grateful this is an option for me!\n",

The trains are never on time, the stations and bart cars are dirty and have homeless, addicts and drug dealers hanging out and bugging people for money. The station agents has never been helpful and they lack customer service skills. For you to make $38/hr I expect better than \"I can't help you\" and the rolling of your eyes. A fare inspection officer makes a minimum of $66,135.46 per year or $5,511 per month why do I see people jumping fare gates? Why aren't you doing your job?

I haven't used this station without being harassed by tweakers, or watching someone get harassed.

I think that Bart needs to hire janitors that has clear statement of work and cleanliness standard. I heard that Bart anitors get paid a lot but I am not sure if there are any cleanliness standard.  They need to hire professional cleaners who will professionally clean this place. I thought that with the Bart fares, Bart management will make an effort to clean all the Bart Stations and trains.

Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.\n",

My husband, myself and my 9 month old baby had to brave your disgusting method of transportation. No one at the Bart station was helpful for starters. It was so noisy on the actual train that I put headphones on my baby. The constant stopping and adding the filth of this city was enough to make me want to walk. A couple of young boys got on and smelled so badly of weed I wanted to vomit. When we arrived at our destination I truly feared for my health and safety. We had a stroller and 3 suitcases and were unable to take the stairs... But I wish I would have. We had to walk to the end of the station to find a working elevator. Again, something out of a scary movie was what we found. The elevator was filled with what appeared to be urine and semen. It was absolutely disgusting and grotesque!!! Then, when we found our exit to union, there were only stairs!!!! We were bombarded by homeless men begging for money. It was dirty and disgusting. This alone was enough to make me want to fly home. Thankfully we found a gem of a hotel in a grotesque part of town. So many homeless, mentally ill and hustlers. Get a job and stop asking tourists for money! Your city needs to focus more on housing the mentally ill than it does on charging people for bags! Who gives an F about the planet when you can't take care of the people who live on it!

BART has gates, unlike Caltrain, so tag on/off with Clipper and don't forget to take your ticket (if you still have money on it) when you exit the station. Also, FYI you get charged a base fee of like $4 or something if you tag on/off at the same station.\n",

It took $5.55 from my card which I haven't entered Bart yet because it went insane or so they say. I realized too late the true missing amount (due to #UNBELIEVABLE thoughts racing through my mind including hearing the TRAINS #PASSING by SO #MANY times underground while another #RUDE customer cuts in about #minor simplicities), but it's over and too much of a hassle to go through. I'm grateful for all the customer service had to offer. I will take #EXTRA #PRECAUTIONS and  be EXTRA #CAUTIOUS next time I use Bart. * BE SURE TO #CALCULATE THE CHEATED DIFFERENCE BEFORE REIMBURSEMENT EVEN IF IT ISN'T YOUR JOB (you can thank me later.) I'm starting out in life and pay income for proposed jobs are similar where I'm from and don't have to take Bart. Now I can choose to work local and dramatically cut costs, time, and unnecessary hassles such as easily magnetized/messed up cards and losing very hard earned money. Nowadays, everything is about profit so we have to pinch every cent and dollar even more to invest and for emergencies.  I'M GLAD I LEARNED A GREAT #LESSON TODAY AND CAN NOW EASILY MAKE #INFORMED DECISIONS. It wasn't worth it what I went through. Bart should up their game and should have allowed the same benefits on plastic cards ever since plastic cards came into being. I never had this issue at other stations while I extensively went to school. Or rarely any issue for that matter except at Bayfair and especially here - when they allowed magnetized paper cards to be traded for several new ones in split amounts for more money added.

I had lived in SF for 5 years and took MUNI and BART so I thought no problem. It was so confusing to figure out how to get a ticket. And then it appeared they wanted us to buy a card (additional cost). Since there were 4 of us, we decided that it would cost about the same to take Lyft directly to the hotel. There wasn't anyone to talk to for assistance. This is madness to have out of towners buy a card that they will never use again. Maybe we didn't navigate correctly. Maybe BART needs to make it easier.\n",

There seems to be no regular effort to wet mop the place to remove the urinetown smell of the station and there were excrements on the floor as well!!!!  I think that Bart needs to hire janitors that has clear statement of work and cleanliness standard. I heard that Bart anitors get paid a lot but I am not sure if there are any cleanliness standard.  They need to hire professional cleaners who will professionally clean this place. I thought that with the Bart fares, Bart management will make an effort to clean all the Bart Stations and trains.

Bart needs to massively improve its cleanliness and need to enforce non loitering. It seems that on a daily basis the seats and floors do not get wiped or mopped as you can still smell in the morning  and all day trace of all kinds of body fluids. Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.\n",

My husband, myself and my 9 month old baby had to brave your disgusting method of transportation. No one at the Bart station was helpful for starters. It was so noisy on the actual train that I put headphones on my baby. The constant stopping and adding the filth of this city was enough to make me want to walk. A couple of young boys got on and smelled so badly of weed I wanted to vomit. When we arrived at our destination I truly feared for my health and safety. We had a stroller and 3 suitcases and were unable to take the stairs... But I wish I would have. We had to walk to the end of the station to find a working elevator. Again, something out of a scary movie was what we found. The elevator was filled with what appeared to be urine and semen. It was absolutely disgusting and grotesque!!! Then, when we found our exit to union, there were only stairs!!!! We were bombarded by homeless men begging for money. It was dirty and disgusting. This alone was enough to make me want to fly home. Thankfully we found a gem of a hotel in a grotesque part of town. So many homeless, mentally ill and hustlers. Get a job and stop asking tourists for money! Your city needs to focus more on housing the mentally ill than it does on charging people for bags! Who gives an F about the planet when you can't take care of the people who live on it! It's a shame that this beautiful city is letting it be overrun by the dirty and mentally ill.\n",

There are endless equipment problems, track issues, medical emergencies that causes major delays. \n",

      "  Review 336: They stole $2.45 from my paper #Bart pass. This is beyond #disrespectful. I have great eye sight and checked all the numbers all the time. It took $5.55 from my card which I haven't entered Bart yet because it went insane or so they say. I realized too late the true missing amount (due to #UNBELIEVABLE thoughts racing through my mind including hearing the TRAINS #PASSING by SO #MANY times underground while another #RUDE customer cuts in about #minor simplicities), but it's over and too much of a hassle to go through. I'm grateful for all the customer service had to offer. I will take #EXTRA #PRECAUTIONS and  be EXTRA #CAUTIOUS next time I use Bart. * BE SURE TO #CALCULATE THE CHEATED DIFFERENCE BEFORE REIMBURSEMENT EVEN IF IT ISN'T YOUR JOB (you can thank me later.) I'm starting out in life and pay income for proposed jobs are similar where I'm from and don't have to take Bart. Now I can choose to work local and dramatically cut costs, time, and unnecessary hassles such as easily magnetized/messed up cards and losing very hard earned money. Nowadays, everything is about profit so we have to pinch every cent and dollar even more to invest and for emergencies.  I'M GLAD I LEARNED A GREAT #LESSON TODAY AND CAN NOW EASILY MAKE #INFORMED DECISIONS. It wasn't worth it what I went through. Bart should up their game and should have allowed the same benefits on plastic cards ever since plastic cards came into being. I never had this issue at other stations while I extensively went to school. Or rarely any issue for that matter except at Bayfair and especially here - when they allowed magnetized paper cards to be traded for several new ones in split amounts for more money added. Is this Bart being #modern, #effective, and #efficient? (Sarcasm)\n",

But whatever it is, it actually announces your stop every step of the way. It takes me all the way from the peninsula to the city! It's fairly clean inside and you can choose wherever you want to sit. For someone who's as spatially challenged as I am, the organization and layout of this station is fantastic--clear signs everywhere--exits and signs to further destinations clearly marked. no confusion whatsoever.

It doesn't help that there is long boring hallways. It's almost as if they built it and said screw it were done. Add some color, some lights, and even some trash cans. I know they are trying to prevent people from eating on the bart but sometimes we have trash. It almost promotes people to just dump it everywhere. \n",

The poor girl was so brave and her mother went straight to the little office at the next stop to report this. The point is: when it's rush hour, keep the damn doors open just a few seconds longer and look out your window to make sure everyone is safe. The driver shut them waaay too soon and barely anyone got in. That's your damn job and I was very disgusted at the drivers carelessness. Someone told the driver over the little speaker that the little girl was hurt and the driver was just like \"I'm just doing my job\". No you weren't you fucking animal and I hope you feel terrible for what you did.\n",

      "  Review 403: Last Saturday I Got on the L car at Embarcadero. As expected, when it got to Powell St station, a thousand Chinese people got on, returning from their grocery shopping in Chinatown. The train became packed like sardines in a can. I was sitting in the isle seat pushed part way into the isle by a portly woman with two big bags. Well, here's where it got interesting: A young Chinese girl, probably 18 to 25 who was standing in the isle ajacent to me, got all shoved up against my arm and shoulder. I didn't mind, as that is the nature of riding the muni. After awhile I noticed a kind of strange motion of her body! Was this my imagination I thought?  No, it actually was happening!  She was busy softly humping my arm!  I'm 74 but I can assure you everything still works.and she was doing a great job of getting the juices going! I sat there and waited to see how long she would keep it up. At  Forrest Hill station she started to pick up the tempo and intensity. There was no doubt she was enjoying what she was doing. At West Portal station, most of the passengers departed. The isle was empty, yet she was still pressed tightly against my arm doing her thing. I looked up at her, she appeared to be staring at the ceiling of the car. Well anyway, she got off at 19th Ave. As she was leaving, I told her discreetly \"Thank You, that was very pleasant !\" She just gave me one of those weird Chinese girl smiles and departed. This was the best Muni ride I have yet. Thank you again whoever you are young lady for making my ride so enjoyable. I doubt that you will ever read this review but  Thanks again!\n",

On the rail you don't have to keep the driver in check to make sure he's not screwing you.  That's nice.

She didn't listen to any of the questions we had, just kept saying that \"if you want me to help you, shut up and listen to what I'm saying\", but didn't have any idea of the info we were looking for.  We actually wanted to take BART, but they sent us to her - major mistake.  My husband and I have had Fast Passes and taken MUNI and BART since 1979 and I have never been treated like this.  She should not be employed in any kind of customer service position and exemplifies the bad profile people have of transit personnel (which we have never had until now).\n",

Of course, this makes it quite a tourist stop, especially on weekends. Still, I'd rather walk than take the train, so I'm happy to get off soon as I can when coming into the City, and this is pretty much it. On the flipside, going home from work on weekday afternoons, I tend to alternate this one with Montgomery. Montgomery is closer, but I don't mind a few minutes extra walk to beat the crowds at the station. Especially if it makes the difference between sitting and standing for the whole ride, or at least until MacArthur.\n",

And as someone walking by, unless you already know and recognize the songs, you might not even know that's what's being performed.

There are plenty of fare gates so I can avoid the tourists who have no idea how to use them. The ticket vending machines are sufficiently out of my way so people queuing up because they failed to by a roundtrip ticket don't obstruct my perfect path to the escalators. I love it when companies buy out the station ad space and trick it out. All this station needs is a nail spa, and I would never leave.\n",

It is clean, the escalators are (almost always) working and there are these hanging digital signs that tell you how long you have to wait! Genius, BART designers, genius. Also, there is very little trash on the tracks and platforms. Another great idea, painting those black rectangles on the platform to line up with where the train doors will open! This allows happy riders to line up at said rectangles and get on in an orderly fashion! Amazing. I wish the NYC MTA would take any one of these ideas to make my visits to the big apple's core more pleasant.\n",

      "  Review 1: It's been years since I've ridden BART, but Civic Center station was ultra convenient to the Orpheum Theater for the closing day of the Wicked tour. My mom and aunt and I felt safe on the train from Bay Fair. The train cars themselves are newer to me, digital line maps and seats clean. Clipper Card tap system as well. Civic Center also had different fare doors, full height to prevent hop overs. When my auntie had trouble with the Clipper Card tapping, an agent was there to assist. Took the stairs and not the escalator, but for a Sunday at noontime the station wasn't bad in terms of crowds or cleanliness. Nor was it bad after the show got out around 4ish. Since the expansion, I wasn't familiar with the lines going to \"Antioch\" (for me that used to be Pittsburgh/Bay Point terminus) or \"Berryessa\" (Fremont).\n",

Civic Center Bart station has to be the most challenging station on the line, when it comes to keeping it clean. There was a lot going on in and around that station. With some law enforcement up top on the street at the entrances, law enforcement even walking the platform! There are some upgrades downstairs, lighting replacement (some, but lots more need replacement consideration), and a generally cleaner station! It has been shown to increase ridership occurs when you give them a clean and safe place! Someone is caring!\n",

It's an insurmountable amount of per. Gallons and gallons of urine they mop up every single day. The drugs. You could probably get anything you want. I get asked if I'm looking for anything each day as I hit the down escalator. Except when there is law enforcement presence, they spread out a bit but they're there. Pee and drugs is enough to one star any place. One could spend hours ready about this place. My review is but another sentence in a gigantic book. And the story goes on and on...Kudos to and and all who chose to work at this station. You are stronger than most. FIVE STARS FOR ALL THAT WORK AT CIVIC CENTER BART STATION!\n",

      "  Review 17: It's amazing what a larger sample size can do for an opinion! 3 months ago I was feeling alright about this station. I feel really bad for the people that have to work at this particular station because it is probably one of the most challenging stations on the system, in the state, and probably a close second to whatever New York or Chicago has for challenges. The influence of the immediate surrounding area makes it next to impossible to cure. From the drug dealers, drug users and other people who urinate on the platform. Yuk! I went to the Powell street station and was amazed about how clean it looked and smelled. I should say, the lack of smell. Here you smell the urine and if you don't pay close attention, you could end up with an oily shoe!\n",

Be careful at both ends of the platform because there is urine on the floor.  I'm not sure why everyone loves to pee down there but it's an everyday thing. The people that have to clean it up daily are to be giving high marks for the nasty work they do. The dope dealing in the stairwell has been cut down in a major way with BART and SFPD have had high visibility in the past couple of months. \n",

      "  Review 21: I try to avoid this station when I can as I've had repeated bad experiences at this stop. The place tends to smell like urine and there are many sticky surfaces to watch out for. I've even witnessed leftover bottles of alcohol. I've also never seen security here. The only times I've had was during the pride parade in SF as there are many bart goers that day. Because of this, I often feel unsafe and have to watch out for myself. For instance, last week I had just gotten off the train and was heading towards the escalator. As I was heading straight, I noticed a white woman with short hair peeking around the corner. I think she was on something because she had her mouth hanging open and was swirling around her tongue. I quickly walked past her but she ended up following me. Luckily, giving her a stern glare was enough to make her back off but if things were to break out then I would have been in trouble. I think it's important that a security guard is always present in case of instances like this turning into something more. This is also not the first time where someone has tried to follow me or even pickpocket me. Please remember to be cautious of your belongings and on the lookout whenever you use bart. You can't rely on security to have your back.\n",

There was a gaggle of guys that had obviously just robbed a tourist or smashed into someone's car. They were passing around a brand new laptop computer discussing it's street value. There were crazies wandering the platform mumbling to themselves. And there was even someone hiding underneath the escalator hissing at people as they walked by. The station was dark and dirtly.\n",

Although the city claims that crime has gone down, the homeless crisis has NOT, and it shows here. Very dangerous area, no matter what time of day. I don't see a lot of cops here, and clearly there should be. This station is located by City Hall, The SHN Orpheum Theatre, and the Bill Graham Civic Center.\n",

      "  Review 29: Hadn't been to Civic Center station I'm forever. It was about 6:30PM and I wondered where the janitorial staff was, as the station needed some TLC. Escalator to UN side was out of order (some things never change I see). There was a cute little family (dad and daughters) dressed in Christmas clothing playing instruments (I should have taken a pic, sorry friends!). The only staff I saw was the agent which is interesting given the size and location of the Civic Center Station. The benefit to using the station is its proximity to downtown SF, namely the Orpheum Theater. It's literally not even three blocks away. Quite a bit of homeless persons were around the stadium but everyone was minding their business (wanted to share that as I know many have concerns but we were fine). When we returned to the station hours later the escalator was still down (one was handicapped in our party so it was an inconvenience). No signage, not safety cones or anything blocking the area off, and it was slippery and wet out. Not a safe way to operate the station, Civic Center.\n",

After your n Judah train outbound went out of service the next train was not coming for another 24 min..that's not good customer service. Put yourself in the riders shoe.\n",

      "  Review 36: I can say this place has been under construction for what seems like decades and the sheer amount of homeless seeking refuge in the expansive labyrinth of underground hallways. There's people sleeping on the floor, there's open and blatant drug use for lack of concern being caught or fined with a misdemeanour and a ticket. It's always such a station that you must use but keep your valuables, cell phones especially from view and use until you're safely on your train going wherever your going. The platform is in a second sub-level as Muni rail is the first sub-level and you have to take an escalator down to the platform and back up when exiting the fare paid area of the BART system. Half the time the escalators are broken down and you have to walk up the thousands of steps to the surface or down to the train platform. This station is notorious for being one of three which those wanting to commit suicide decide to step in front of approaching trains causing system wide delays and a huge police and medical personnel. I'd avoid it if I could but it's the station closest to my house so I have to put up with the terrible conditions and state of things.\n",

If I'm not mistaken there are a number of transportation stations which various groups have taken efforts to recognize or preserve immediately or in the future because of cultural or historic significance, although I'm not entirely sure who they are or how this process works. The Civic Center itself seems to have been recognized as a National Historic Landmark District. Not sure if this includes the BART Station.\n",

They are walking biohazards with stained clothes shedding body fluids everywhere (urine, feces, saliva, blood, semen) on and off the trains. Please think about this.  I am very serious and am not an alarmist. This is a huge public health matter. These people need help and allowing these continued behaviors is enabling and encouraging this. On 5/20 some wonderful BART user filmed the hallway at this station, illustrating the multiple people using drugs. This video was shown on the news that day. We all need to do this.

So I then said, City Hall. This sister then rolled her eyes at me as if I insulted her or was difficult. So I asked, did I offend you in some way? And she bluntly replied that my question was not asked properly. Rolled eyes from one black woman to another means that she's dismissing me, that I don't matter and what I want doesn't matter. I asked her her name and she rudely replied, \"Station Agent\". She then put her hand up to the window in my face. With BART having all the recent bad press and the Civic Center is where many dignitaries and community advocates use, she made a mistake with me.

The elevators are equally as disgusting and somehow the escalators always seem to be broken and you have to go up and down the stairs which sucks considering that this bart station happens to be one is the lowest bart stations. Avoid taking this bart station late at night or anytime after 7pm for that matter. Carry around pepper spray or mini taser if you absolutely have to take bart from this station.

Watch out for homeless people skipping the ticket machines. They are usually harmless, but during low traffic periods like Saturday morning, there are not that many security around. The overhead speaker system will shout out good citizen propaganda like reporting suspicious activity. The trains get continual time updates on the board, so you don't have to question when your train is about to arrive.

With some law enforcement up top on the street at the entrances, law enforcement even walking the platform! There are some upgrades downstairs, lighting replacement (some, but lots more need replacement consideration), and a generally cleaner station! It has been shown to increase ridership occurs when you give them a clean and safe place! Someone is caring!\n",

I get asked if I'm looking for anything each day as I hit the down escalator. Except when there is law enforcement presence, they spread out a bit but they're there. Pee and drugs is enough to one star any place. One could spend hours ready about this place. My review is but another sentence in a gigantic book. And the story goes on and on...Kudos to and and all who chose to work at this station. You are stronger than most. FIVE STARS FOR ALL THAT WORK AT CIVIC CENTER BART STATION!\n",

I feel really bad for the people that have to work at this particular station because it is probably one of the most challenging stations on the system, in the state, and probably a close second to whatever New York or Chicago has for challenges. The influence of the immediate surrounding area makes it next to impossible to cure. From the drug dealers, drug users and other people who urinate on the platform. Yuk! I went to the Powell street station and was amazed about how clean it looked and smelled. I should say, the lack of smell. Here you smell the urine and if you don't pay close attention, you could end up with an oily shoe!\n",

The people that have to clean it up daily are to be giving high marks for the nasty work they do.

      "  Review 253: I try to avoid this station when I can as I've had repeated bad experiences at this stop. The place tends to smell like urine and there are many sticky surfaces to watch out for. I've even witnessed leftover bottles of alcohol. I've also never seen security here. The only times I've had was during the pride parade in SF as there are many bart goers that day. Because of this, I often feel unsafe and have to watch out for myself. For instance, last week I had just gotten off the train and was heading towards the escalator. As I was heading straight, I noticed a white woman with short hair peeking around the corner. I think she was on something because she had her mouth hanging open and was swirling around her tongue. I quickly walked past her but she ended up following me. Luckily, giving her a stern glare was enough to make her back off but if things were to break out then I would have been in trouble. I think it's important that a security guard is always present in case of instances like this turning into something more. This is also not the first time where someone has tried to follow me or even pickpocket me. Please remember to be cautious of your belongings and on the lookout whenever you use bart. You can't rely on security to have your back.\n",

In writing this review, I did a quick search to find some history on the station, but haven't been able to find anything substantial. If I'm not mistaken there are a number of transportation stations which various groups have taken efforts to recognize or preserve immediately or in the future because of cultural or historic significance, although I'm not entirely sure who they are or how this process works. The Civic Center itself seems to have been recognized as a National Historic Landmark District. Not sure if this includes the BART Station.\n",

She looked back at me with a scowl and puzzled look. So I then said, City Hall. This sister then rolled her eyes at me as if I insulted her or was difficult. So I asked, did I offend you in some way? And she bluntly replied that my question was not asked properly. Rolled eyes from one black woman to another means that she's dismissing me, that I don't matter and what I want doesn't matter. I asked her her name and she rudely replied, \"Station Agent\". She then put her hand up to the window in my face. With BART having all the recent bad press and the Civic Center is where many dignitaries and community advocates use, she made a mistake with me.

The elevators are equally as disgusting and somehow the escalators always seem to be broken and you have to go up and down the stairs which sucks considering that this bart station happens to be one is the lowest bart stations. Avoid taking this bart station late at night or anytime after 7pm for that matter. Carry around pepper spray or mini taser if you absolutely have to take bart from this station.

A second person standing by the BART ticket machine wanted money \"to catch the last bus out of here\" (BART isn't a bus and it's still running for two more hours). A third person asked me for money on the escalator down to the platform.\n",

There was a cute little family (dad and daughters) dressed in Christmas clothing playing instruments (I should have taken a pic, sorry friends!). The only staff I saw was the agent which is interesting given the size and location of the Civic Center Station. The benefit to using the station is its proximity to downtown SF, namely the Orpheum Theater. It's literally not even three blocks away. Quite a bit of homeless persons were around the stadium but everyone was minding their business (wanted to share that as I know many have concerns but we were fine). When we returned to the station hours later the escalator was still down (one was handicapped in our party so it was an inconvenience). No signage, not safety cones or anything blocking the area off, and it was slippery and wet out. Not a safe way to operate the station, Civic Center.\n",

There's people sleeping on the floor, there's open and blatant drug use for lack of concern being caught or fined with a misdemeanour and a ticket. It's always such a station that you must use but keep your valuables, cell phones especially from view and use until you're safely on your train going wherever your going. The platform is in a second sub-level as Muni rail is the first sub-level and you have to take an escalator down to the platform and back up when exiting the fare paid area of the BART system. Half the time the escalators are broken down and you have to walk up the thousands of steps to the surface or down to the train platform. This station is notorious for being one of three which those wanting to commit suicide decide to step in front of approaching trains causing system wide delays and a huge police and medical personnel.

A couple of guys who are always hanging out on that corner instantly ran down the stairs to get the BART attendant who was working at the booth next to the elevator to the platforms on the 7th street side of the station. She came over eventually- but it was someone else who turned the escalator off using the emergency kill switch. Only problem was Madison's foot was still stuck in the escalator. Passengers, store owners, neighbors, tourists were all throwing ideas to the attendent who seemed content just to stand there and stare with everyone else. Finally she went to call BART police.

Later I find out there was a 3 day pass that was unlimited and that he was just trying to get his city taxes dollars out of me. I almost had to fight a crazy lady on the MUNI who thought I was standing too close to her wheelchair; seeing that the bus was full, I had no choice but to be next to her. I think she was afraid I was going to steal her cup where she panhandles for money. The trolley guy who collects the money was extremely rude. I guess that's the public transportation for you.\n",

      "  Review 23: I've been through this station maybe 5 times before tonight, over the last 10 years living in the Bay area (not in SF). I made the trip in from Oakland, to meet my hubby to meet friends for dinner. I knew that this station has always been unsavory, so I was hesitant to go back there. I was not happy to have to walk up the super long staircase, upon arrival, due to the escalator being out  of service. As expected, when I got to street level, I was instantly disgusted by lots of homeless guys (and maybe one gal) hanging out right there, just like I've seen before. My hubby was waiting for me a few steps away from them. Our dinner went a bit later than I thought it would, and thank god the muscular guy who our friend is dating, offered to walk us over to the station - before they got their UBER ride down the block! We of course, had to walk past the creepy people again, on our way to the entrance. and some guy mocked us a bit. Eesh. We went down the escalator (at least the DOWN one worked) and saw two female police officers on guard. Then we saw them again, plus a male officer, while we waited about 5 minutes for out train. I was relieved to get out  of there. Our ride was bumpy, I don't recall the train every shaking so much in the 10 years we've lived here! Then, for extra fun, I had to worry again, because I had parked at MacArthur station - which I've avoided and had refused to ever go back to again, since a 19 year old girl was stabbed to death there recently (about two months ago?). Good times! AVOID the 16th Street BART station unless you MUST be there! Don't look at the vagrants hanging out, just walk fast and keep going. Better yet, stay HOME.\n",

But I was feeling confident and adventurous, so I looked up our destination and realized that we could get off on 16th St. Mission, then take a bus to our final destination. BIG mistake. The stop was dark and underground, as soon as we surfaced to street level- we realized our mistake. There was a protest going on across the street, men yelling at each other and aggressive people everywhere. We quickly oriented ourselves and got the heck out of there, and made sure we stayed on the BART until Powell for the remainder of our trip. The station was trashed and smelled of urine, overall did not feel safe. Would not recommend unless you are familiar with the neighborhood, and know where you are going.\n",

Only reason I'm posting a review is to say if you're a woman, elderly, or parents of children who are going to travel on BART, NEVER under any circumstance use this station.  The station at 24th and Misson one stop up is no garden spot but it is dramatically safer.\n",

      "  Review 70: Yes, this is the Bart station where the infamous naked acrobat incident occurred. The station has one of those bike friendly rails where you can put the wheels in the slit and easily push it as you walk up and down the stairs. Lots of stairs and chances are you will run into a day where the escalator is out of order, forcing you to work out your legs. The urine smell is the worst out of all the stations. I know 24th Mission station has a similar stank but I haven't been there enough to tell you if it is on the same level or worse. As you are going up the escalator or walking up the stairs, it will hit and greet you. \n",

To those individuals who can be easily identified (or mistaken) as a member of the LGBTQQIA community, I would exercise some caution around the homeless.

I made the trip in from Oakland, to meet my hubby to meet friends for dinner. I knew that this station has always been unsavory, so I was hesitant to go back there. I was not happy to have to walk up the super long staircase, upon arrival, due to the escalator being out  of service. As expected, when I got to street level, I was instantly disgusted by lots of homeless guys (and maybe one gal) hanging out right there, just like I've seen before. My hubby was waiting for me a few steps away from them. Our dinner went a bit later than I thought it would, and thank god the muscular guy who our friend is dating, offered to walk us over to the station - before they got their UBER ride down the block! We of course, had to walk past the creepy people again, on our way to the entrance. and some guy mocked us a bit. Eesh. We went down the escalator (at least the DOWN one worked) and saw two female police officers on guard. Then we saw them again, plus a male officer, while we waited about 5 minutes for out train. I was relieved to get out  of there. Our ride was bumpy, I don't recall the train every shaking so much in the 10 years we've lived here! Then, for extra fun, I had to worry again, because I had parked at MacArthur station - which I've avoided and had refused to ever go back to again, since a 19 year old girl was stabbed to death there recently (about two months ago?). Good times! AVOID the 16th Street BART station unless you MUST be there! Don't look at the vagrants hanging out, just walk fast and keep going. Better yet, stay HOME.\n",

I'm sure there are places with more crime, and there are a bunch of places, many really close to this intersection, that are much more dangerous to be standing around at; but I've seen more drugs change hands here in front of my face than I've seen in my entire life, and I haven't even lived in San Francisco for five years.\n",

Even with my husband it was an unpleasant, disgusting experience.  The escalators weren't working- so we had to lug our suitcases down the stairs- not easy for a disabled person, let me tell you.  Avoid this place if you possibly can.  Yuck.\n",

When we got there, it was full of very interesting people- several of whom were passed out on the ground.  It's incredibly dirty, and I'd never want to be there alone.

Or if not intentional then with reckless disregard of the needs of most persons for an assurance they are welcomed and valued. The architectural school, however, is enjoying a renaissance because of how it photographs. The massed concrete and simple forms look great and even profound rendered as social media squares the size of thumbnails. The discipline is evident. The John Wick like commitment to a vision more or less indifferent to emotional yearnings for a sense of community. \n",

It often smells like marijuana and there's a lot more hustlers, young delinquents, and sketchy looking individuals as well as what seems to be folks with mental health issues who ride the MTA in the LA area, so it does in fact feel a bit less safe.

Look past the swag and you'll find shes also a nature girl with a green thumb, who sells fresh flowers for us to bring home to loved ones.  Ms. Park is a firm believer in \"Stranger Danger\", so she avoids associating with trashy people (she won't even say hello to sketchy nearby neighbors like 24th Mission and tragic also-rans like Balboa Park).

But this is to be expected in any city, so it's something I've grown accustomed (but not fond of) to.

First, the finally created a dedicated platform for folks to catch the J & K trains to downtown.  The downside is that the platform to downtown is located in the middle of the block on San Jose Ave., between Geneva Ave. and Ocean Ave.  Another downside is that the last stop for the J & K are way closer to the Ocean Ave. side, although BART has since opened a dedicated gate on that side so folks don't need to walk all the way closer to the Geneva Ave. side of the station to enter to BART.  However, for folks that need to get to the Geneva side, it is a much longer walk.  They did make the trek a bit easier by building a level dedicated walkway with a railing that will keep you off the tracks.\n",

Other than the fact that you can get to every station on BART from here, the J, K, & M Muni Metro lines all terminate here as well, but none of those trains actually stop INSIDE Balboa Park.  You have to navigate around narrow pathways and it is especially dangerous in one section where both the J & K makes a slight left turn next to a pathway that is maybe one foot wide because a pole stands in the way.  I'm surprised no one has been run over yet.. I've seen plenty of people run against red lights at Geneva & San Jose and narrowly averting getting killed to catch the M.   \n",

The 49 bus stops on the Ocean St. side and you have to walk the length of a football field to get inside the station.. WTF?!\n",

The downside is that the platform to downtown is located in the middle of the block on San Jose Ave., between Geneva Ave. and Ocean Ave.  Another downside is that the last stop for the J & K are way closer to the Ocean Ave. side, although BART has since opened a dedicated gate on that side so folks don't need to walk all the way closer to the Geneva Ave. side of the station to enter to BART.  However, for folks that need to get to the Geneva side, it is a much longer walk.  They did make the trek a bit easier by building a level dedicated walkway with a railing that will keep you off the tracks.\n",

You have to navigate around narrow pathways and it is especially dangerous in one section where both the J & K makes a slight left turn next to a pathway that is maybe one foot wide because a pole stands in the way.

If you can't find any parking in the main lot or overflow, next to the overflow lot there is a little parking lot you can pay to park at for a reasonable price. I prefer to drive to this station when heading to the city so I can take any train from SF back to the east bay without having to wait for a particular train. Like anywhere in Oakland, I would advise you not to leave anything valuable in the car as break-ins can occur regularly.\n",

For example there is a pigeons nest directly over the up escalator for the westbound platform. It has been up there for years, and pigeons defecate on customers coming up the escalator.\n",

      "  Review 22: For many years, this was my favorite spot to head on over to Downtown San Francisco. I used to love coming here, but no more. No more street parking (limited to two hours) and the parking situation in the parking lot is insane. And the payment is equally insane, so I'm not crazy about it. I used to be able to find decent parking, but I'll say that it's better than driving over there, but not ideal. I now park at Del Norte, North Berkeley, or even Lake Merritt. But if I have to come here, I do. I just have to make sure that I get there hours early so that I can find parking and have time to walk the long 4-6 blocks to the station.\n",

And I went over to her, and explained what happened, and she said so you just pushed your way in, didn't you. ( in a really really rude tone)  and said I didn't. She said you did I saw you. Which I really didn't, cause I'm not focus my way in and the reason I talk to her is to ask if she can double check I'm charged on the way in,  cause I don't want to get outage in the way out, she just wouldn't  listen.  She saw I'm arrived oakland which I explained to her that's not the case I'm going to sf for work. And she wouldn't listen. I am decent dress with professional suits, And I have my Bart ticket on my hand the whole time. I don't know why she would assume I'm a criminal when I talk to her ask for help. And in reality people escaped from the Bart ticket in the location all the time cause they left the said door open. I saw it multiple time. They saw it and just do nothing. I was amazed how little effort they put in they work. But today my situation shows some of them might  just racist.  The picking on someone who doesn't looks local or have accent\n",

I am sorry to be carrier of bad news but two nights ago 10-25-18 at 10.15pm, I was assaulted and robbed by four individuals inside West Oakland BART station right in front of the security and information booth. The man in charge of the booth had left his post few seconds before I was robbed. That mugging looked as a coordinated action among the employee and the robbers. This man in charge of the booth had indicated me few minutes before the assault that the stop of the Bolt Bus with destiny to Angeles was at dark and secluded area behind the BART station. When I followed his instructions, the guys went after me, so I returned immediately to the Booth. Right immediately the man in charge left his post and the assault happened without regard of few bystanders. There was nobody there to help and call the police. The robbers never left the place, they stood there watching me and few seconds later tried to rob a young lady that started to yell and scared them off to a short distance. Finally, i saw my bus, ran to the Bolt bus stop which was located a block away on Seven St. Then, I checked in and departed to Los Angeles. Those guys took all my cash and scared the crap out of me.

      "  Review 63: This is a review for the whole Bart. Bart has wonderful front office staff always. Bart is great because of its accessibility and parking as well schedule. Bart needs to massively improve its cleanliness and need to enforce non loitering. It seems that on a daily basis the seats and floors do not get wiped or mopped as you can still smell in the morning  and all day trace of all kinds of body fluids. Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.  I would pay a little bit more to make this happen.\n",

There isn't a great way to get from Emeryville to this BART station by public transportation. Driving, while fast, means you'll have to deal with the underwhelming parking situation. The lot fills up fast, and has the steepest daily price tag of any BART station at $7. Unless you're a really early bird, you're more likely to end up parking in one of the (non-BART-affiliated) auxiliary lots, which cost even more - somewhere between $8 and $10 a day presently. That's starting to approach downtown SF parking prices, which makes you begin to wonder, why take BART at all? The cost of the Bay Bridge toll is comparable to a round trip BART ticket from West Oakland to Embarcadero or Montgomery.\n",

Yes, I realize that it's coming out of the Transbay Tube, so it makes more sense for the tracks to be as close together as they are, but there is enough lead distance, I believe, to have separated the tracks and put in place a central platform that services trains going in either direction.

Also, the escalator to the platform of the San Francisco direction was out of order for the longest time!

I come here is I can on Saturdays instead of going to my regular stop of Lake Merrit just for the expediency of the trip and probability of catching a train as I stated above, but I only do it on Saturday when parking is free. Parking during the week is crazy expensive and not worth it. I think it's $5, but it could be more since prices are always going up with BART. I know from the statements of others that parking during the week gets packed, but from first hand experience if you desire to come here on a Saturday morning, give yourself time because it looks like Costco with people sharking to get a parking spot. Seriously, give yourself time. Otherwise you will have to find some place on the street that isn't permit or 2 hour parking to park your car, and the perimeter of the BART station has street cleaning on Saturday, and people do take the ticket if they are desperate. Parking is really the only negative I can find for this place.\n",

The lot fills up fast, and has the steepest daily price tag of any BART station at $7. Unless you're a really early bird, you're more likely to end up parking in one of the (non-BART-affiliated) auxiliary lots, which cost even more - somewhere between $8 and $10 a day presently. That's starting to approach downtown SF parking prices, which makes you begin to wonder, why take BART at all?

Yes, I realize that it's coming out of the Transbay Tube, so it makes more sense for the tracks to be as close together as they are, but there is enough lead distance, I believe, to have separated the tracks and put in place a central platform that services trains going in either direction.

The worst that's happened to me is that I got my bike seat stolen - and then I learned how to use one of the many secure bike lockers available at the station! I also don't look clueless or frightened. All sorts of folks of all backgrounds use this station everyday, and the vast majority of them seem to not have a problem.\n",

The man in charge of the booth had left his post few seconds before I was robbed. That mugging looked as a coordinated action among the employee and the robbers. This man in charge of the booth had indicated me few minutes before the assault that the stop of the Bolt Bus with destiny to Angeles was at dark and secluded area behind the BART station. When I followed his instructions, the guys went after me, so I returned immediately to the Booth. Right immediately the man in charge left his post and the assault happened without regard of few bystanders. There was nobody there to help and call the police. The robbers never left the place, they stood there watching me and few seconds later tried to rob a young lady that started to yell and scared them off to a short distance. Finally, i saw my bus, ran to the Bolt bus stop which was located a block away on Seven St. Then, I checked in and departed to Los Angeles. Those guys took all my cash and scared the crap out of me.

      "  Review 442: Before last Friday, I would have given W Oakland Bart 4 stars easily (wish they had more benches outside for people waiting on their ride but understand they want to discourage loitering)---however, given my disturbing experience with BART Security or whatever the Angry Man was, i have to knock it back to 1 star. One would think, in light of the terrible incident of Jan 1st and all the protests that BART employees would be especially civil to the public. Around 4:30p last Friday I pulled into W Oak BART to pick up J (returning from MacWorld)...there was such a crush of cars that I took the opportunity to pull into an empty Bart Agent space (thinking that I would wait there for a few minutes until the crowd thinned out). I had been parked for all of ten seconds (with my windows rolled down) when I become aware of a man SCREAMING at me at the TOP of his lungs and then he POUNDED the hood of my car. I was really frightened. He wasn't dressed in a BART uniform or even wearing a name tag. He kept screaming at me repeatedly to move. So I backed out, but leaned over to the passenger window and told him that it wasn't necessary to touch my car nor scream at me. He then SCREAMED again at me saying, \"You parked in my space!\" By that point, there was a crowd of people going back and forth and I decided to hold my tongue. Ironically, a space right next to the Agent space just opened up at that moment so I decided to take it. The Angry Man put an ORANGE CONE (he wasn't even using the space) into the Agent space and then settled himself back into his car (parked in the 2nd Agent space). I was fuming. \n",

This is the BART station I exited at in Oakland, and then again returned to when I desired to get back to my car at Millbrae BART station afterwards. The station was clean(ish), the trains were on time(ish) and everything was where it should be. Helpful maps and electronic signs were on the walls, there were people were there to answer my questions if I had any, and, in addition, they've got a free wi-fi bubble here. It's very well organized, and quite helpful. They're not that far from Jackson Square, and I will more than likely be using this particular BART station again on my next trip up that-a-way.\n",

One best way to get a seat leaving the city is boarding the first car which dumps you here at the end of the station. The trouble is taking the stairs  downstairs being the farthest point of the station, occasionally the corner of stairs is used as emergency urinal. That is so Bart. News of similar events on the trains would not surprise any riders and why should this? Whatever. Third rate train service is best Bay Area has. Efficiency is all this and many stations have. That is C grade in academic terms. Bart is very good at meeting C grade standards. And their culture does not understand concepts like quality some may say. That would be B grade or above in academic terms. We know which portion of population are sought for Bart labor force. Anything above C graders will be complainers and no wonder D graders and F graders love to ride Bart for adventure and mayhem. Nobody above a C grade intellect would come near Bart UNLESS THEY HAVE TO. Bart also excels at not hearing anything but their own voice. Here is 12th Street as a typical Bart station.

I also have ridden BART from this point to Downtown San Francisco.  I consider this \"subway\" station and the many bus routes above the \"boardwalk\" aka Broadway the transit hub of Downtown Oakland.  Heading to JLS?  This is the station to get off at, and one has a choice of catching the 72 or 72M (AC) or the Shuttle bus...which is cool.  City Center with the shops and restaurants and facing the Federal Building - 13th Street exit (westerly direction); Frank Ogawa Plaza, Tully's Coffee, City Hall and State Building - 14th Street exit (northerly and westerly direction); Oakland Chinatown, EBMUD - 11th Street exit and a two blocks walk in a southerly and easterly direction, respectively; and 12th, 13th and 14th Street exits (easterly direction) one will see Goodwill Industries, Burger King, DeLauer's bookstore, Rite Aid, etc., respectively.\n",

There are elevators that service this station to the street and to the platforms mind you they do smell of urine, but most major cities subway systems always seem to have this issue so this wasn't a shock to me.  Also several of the exits also escalators too so if you have luggage.  Bart gets the job done, although be sure to look and see where the final stop is versus looking at the color of the line as the maps on the trains allude to, the colors are meaningless as I found out on my return to the airport.\n",

Bart needs to massively improve its cleanliness and need to enforce non loitering. It seems that on a daily basis the seats and floors do not get wiped or mopped as you can still smell in the morning  and all day trace of all kinds of body fluids. Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.

I also have ridden BART from this point to Downtown San Francisco.  I consider this \"subway\" station and the many bus routes above the \"boardwalk\" aka Broadway the transit hub of Downtown Oakland.  Heading to JLS?  This is the station to get off at, and one has a choice of catching the 72 or 72M (AC) or the Shuttle bus...which is cool.  City Center with the shops and restaurants and facing the Federal Building - 13th Street exit (westerly direction); Frank Ogawa Plaza, Tully's Coffee, City Hall and State Building - 14th Street exit (northerly and westerly direction); Oakland Chinatown, EBMUD - 11th Street exit and a two blocks walk in a southerly and easterly direction, respectively; and 12th, 13th and 14th Street exits (easterly direction) one will see Goodwill Industries, Burger King, DeLauer's bookstore, Rite Aid, etc., respectively.\n",

What I loved about it was its central location. It's right in the middle of the BART map, so many directions are open to you without having to transfer trains. If you need to go to SF, you could get there in one go, and same deal if you're going to North Oakland or Berkeley. As a frequent commuter this was really a luxury.\n",

That would be B grade or above in academic terms. We know which portion of population are sought for Bart labor force. Anything above C graders will be complainers and no wonder D graders and F graders love to ride Bart for adventure and mayhem.

We were going to see a performance at the Paramount Theater. The 19th Street Station placed us literally across the street from the theater.

Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.

As you can understand, I was very confused as to why I would not get my ticket back which had a remaining balance on it. The money on that card belonged to me. This BART agent continued to treat me very unprofessionally. The BART agent said that she should be charging me $5.25 for a lost ticket. My ticket was right there, in her hand! I told her repeatedly that I want my remaining balance and I didn't understand why she would not return the ticket, I did nothing wrong. She told me that she couldn't prove that I got on at Montgomery and continued to refuse to give me my ticket back. I repeatedly told this agent that I put my ticket in the machine at Montgomery, it came out of the top of the machine, but obviously didn't properly record where I was. Therefore, I should not be at fault for the machine's error. Her response was that I couldn't prove that the machine had messed up, that there is no record of where I was coming from. Although she couldn't prove either that I \"was lying\", this BART agent took it upon herself to make sure that the customer was at fault, to not give me the benefit of the doubt, thus making me pay the price for BART's mechanical problems. She said either I exit without my remaining balance or I pay the $5.25.

      "  Review 124: This review is for service that occured on May 14, 2012 between 5-5:30pm at the 19th St. Bart Station. The worst help/service I've ever received from public transportation employees! I have a clipper card and it has been blocked due to theft on my autoload card. I had it unblocked on May 9th and Clipper's customer service told me it was ready for use but first needed to be \"picked up\" by tapping it on a \"ticket vending machine.\" I thought this was the \"add fare machine\" but apparently they are different. I go to a BART agent on the 20th St. side and he has no idea what what I am talking about. He tells me to call Clipper customer service again and let them know the situation. So this is my 2nd time calling and was on hold for 13 mins... that was the least of my problems. I had the representative on the phone to explain to the BART agent (on the 20th St. side)  and he kept saying sorry I don't know what that is. I eventually hung up with Clipper customer service. Since the Bart Agent had no idea, I figured he was a new employee. At least he was sincere about not knowing. I walked over to the 19th St. side BART agents and there were two of them! Great I figured someone should know what to do. A lady named Collette and an African American man were in the booth. Collette was sincere about the situation altough she didn't know what to do was still very understanding to the situation. But the African American man went off on me in a rather harsh tone because I tried to explain what Clipper customer service told me. He was short with me and interrupted me at every moment I tried to talk. I asked to speak to a manager and he said \"Pssshhh lease\" Im guessing that meant \"Please\" I guess he didn't finish grade school or something. He then yelled and cut off Collette because she tried to defend me by saying, \"I think she is right, she has to go to the Embarcadero Station to the Clipper customer service agent.\" He yelled at his own Co-worker!!! He kept sayiing \"I know about this and there is nothing we can do.\" He then went inside the booth and shut the door. Seriously?! I almost thought I was in elementary school. How childish was that? I seriously rethink of BART employees such as him as \"ignorant fools\" I thought agents were supposed to help you with problems such as these. I'm so glad I wasn't asking for directions. He might have told me to go Africa or something. *Sigh* really all I can say at this point is \"ignorance excuses no one.\" I should actually bring it up to BART management...*hint hint*\n",

First off, if you're headed towards Fremont at the end of a work day, the train is far less crowded than getting on at 12th St yet the fare down there is the same.  It's only a few extra blocks so take a walk to it.  Other factors include that there's a Subway Sandwich shop underground in the station (but outside the fare gates), that's a really cool idea and wish BART had more joint things like that.  There is also an underground connection to Sears as well although that's now closed unfortunately.  The station does everything 12th St does but does it a little quieter, therefore, my favorite.  The only knock is no cell service in downtown Oakland stations, unlike those in SF.  C'mon guys, upgrade!\n",

We were going to see a performance at the Paramount Theater. The 19th Street Station placed us literally across the street from the theater.

I put $7.10 on my ticket, the exact fare to get from Rockridge to Montgomery and back ($3.55 per way). I got to work in the morning as usual. During the evening commute, however, there were some complications. I entered at New Montgomery and Market. Once I arrived at the BART gates at 4:32pm (plus or minus 1 minute), I put my paper ticket through the entrance machine, waited for the ticket to pop up, and the gates to open. I grabbed my ticket after what had seemed like a normal entry process. I boarded the Concord train, which came at 4:40pm. I decided to get off at 19th Street Station, rather than Rockridge, as I needed to run an errand downtown before returning home.  Exiting at 19th Street would leave me with .40 cents remaining on my card ($3.55 minus $3.15).\n",

I proceeded to the agent's box and handed her my ticket. First she asked where I was coming from and I told her Montgomery. The BART agent said that I could simply exit out the side door, but forgot to hand me my ticket back.  I responded, \"What about my ticket?\". She told me that she would not return my ticket to me. As you can understand, I was very confused as to why I would not get my ticket back which had a remaining balance on it. The money on that card belonged to me. This BART agent continued to treat me very unprofessionally. The BART agent said that she should be charging me $5.25 for a lost ticket. My ticket was right there, in her hand! I told her repeatedly that I want my remaining balance and I didn't understand why she would not return the ticket, I did nothing wrong. She told me that she couldn't prove that I got on at Montgomery and continued to refuse to give me my ticket back. I repeatedly told this agent that I put my ticket in the machine at Montgomery, it came out of the top of the machine, but obviously didn't properly record where I was. Therefore, I should not be at fault for the machine's error. Her response was that I couldn't prove that the machine had messed up, that there is no record of where I was coming from. Although she couldn't prove either that I \"was lying\", this BART agent took it upon herself to make sure that the customer was at fault, to not give me the benefit of the doubt, thus making me pay the price for BART's mechanical problems. She said either I exit without my remaining balance or I pay the $5.25. She left me with no others options except to leave after several minutes of debate and continue this conversation with BART officials above her.\n",

I am extremely offended that BART, a system which I choose to support and ride every day, is falsely accusing me of not paying my fare, and essentially stealing. I am let down by how this was handled and I am shocked that your employees would behave so unethically. I am not comfortable supporting a system which accuses it's paying customers of being dishonest.

      "  Review 280: This review is for service that occured on May 14, 2012 between 5-5:30pm at the 19th St. Bart Station. The worst help/service I've ever received from public transportation employees! I have a clipper card and it has been blocked due to theft on my autoload card. I had it unblocked on May 9th and Clipper's customer service told me it was ready for use but first needed to be \"picked up\" by tapping it on a \"ticket vending machine.\" I thought this was the \"add fare machine\" but apparently they are different. I go to a BART agent on the 20th St. side and he has no idea what what I am talking about. He tells me to call Clipper customer service again and let them know the situation. So this is my 2nd time calling and was on hold for 13 mins... that was the least of my problems. I had the representative on the phone to explain to the BART agent (on the 20th St. side)  and he kept saying sorry I don't know what that is. I eventually hung up with Clipper customer service. Since the Bart Agent had no idea, I figured he was a new employee. At least he was sincere about not knowing. I walked over to the 19th St. side BART agents and there were two of them! Great I figured someone should know what to do. A lady named Collette and an African American man were in the booth. Collette was sincere about the situation altough she didn't know what to do was still very understanding to the situation. But the African American man went off on me in a rather harsh tone because I tried to explain what Clipper customer service told me. He was short with me and interrupted me at every moment I tried to talk. I asked to speak to a manager and he said \"Pssshhh lease\" Im guessing that meant \"Please\" I guess he didn't finish grade school or something. He then yelled and cut off Collette because she tried to defend me by saying, \"I think she is right, she has to go to the Embarcadero Station to the Clipper customer service agent.\" He yelled at his own Co-worker!!! He kept sayiing \"I know about this and there is nothing we can do.\" He then went inside the booth and shut the door. Seriously?! I almost thought I was in elementary school. How childish was that? I seriously rethink of BART employees such as him as \"ignorant fools\" I thought agents were supposed to help you with problems such as these. I'm so glad I wasn't asking for directions. He might have told me to go Africa or something. *Sigh* really all I can say at this point is \"ignorance excuses no one.\" I should actually bring it up to BART management...*hint hint*\n",

There are always people mis behaving on the trains, sometimes mildly- listening to boom boxes super loud, creating their own raps or songs.. sometimes misbehaving BADLY- fighting, smoking pot (and once it was either crack or meth), drinking, playing with ones \"part\" lol, you're getting my drift..\n",

We were between the MacArthur Station and 19th Street, not yet underground but beneath the various freeway overpasses and such. There was a patch of grass, I am guessing around 27th Street. This patch of grass was bordered by the BART tracks, the freeway and some deserted street. On this patch of grass grew a tree, and underneath the shade of said anemic tree was what appeared to be a man. As the train got closer to this scene, I realized that it was, indeed, a man. And that the man was nude. Also, the man was on all fours. This was getting good. We got closer and I realized that the man was actually on all *threes*. Was this an amputee, I wondered?

First off, if you're headed towards Fremont at the end of a work day, the train is far less crowded than getting on at 12th St yet the fare down there is the same.  It's only a few extra blocks so take a walk to it.  Other factors include that there's a Subway Sandwich shop underground in the station (but outside the fare gates), that's a really cool idea and wish BART had more joint things like that.  There is also an underground connection to Sears as well although that's now closed unfortunately.  The station does everything 12th St does but does it a little quieter, therefore, my favorite.  The only knock is no cell service in downtown Oakland stations, unlike those in SF.  C'mon guys, upgrade!\n",

Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.

For instance, today - it took me over 2 hours to go from Pittsburg to SF.  I was forced to change trains and had to stand, with my suitcase for 9 slow stops because of it. With non- stop starts & stops, being thrown around in a hot train - I am done with you. All they can tell me is its a service situation. Maybe you should take better care of your trains & tracks!  I should have just driven & paid for valet, at $26 for 2 people to ride it would have been faster, cleaner & cheaper.\n",

      "  Review 71: I would like to inform you that I am a Mon - Fri commuter. I take BART from El Cerrito del Norte and get off at Colma BART station. I had always been cautious about bedbugs and wondered why there haven't been any outbreaks on BART especially because people do bring them with them via their luggage while traveling. It's a fact! People can also bring them along if their homes are infested and they ride on BART they can easily fall off and land inside. As I left from work yesterday (4/22/2014) I got on the Pittsburg/Bay Point train. I was sitting inside train Number 1853 on the side seats right nest to the doors because I need easy access to exit since I was going to transfer on McArthur AND I'm pregnant, next to door #5. I usually place my backpack on the ground so I reached down to grab my backpack and placed it on my lap to get my gatorade drink. When I was done sipping on it, I placed my backpack back on the floor in between my legs. I had then noticed something moving on my left leg and I just thought it was a lint or something so I tried brushing it off but it would not come off, I then thought.... \"oh shit, this is a bedbug!\" so I grabbed it and sure enough it was a freaking bedbug! It was a pale brown color meaning it had not had a blood meal and it was not big enough to be an adult. It was still a nymph. Ironically, I work for a pest control company and I have been in the industry for over 10 years so I can tell you that what I saw and identified was 100% BEDBUG! As soon as I got off the train at El Cerrito del Norte, I notified the employee at the booth and all he said to me was, \"you need to fill out this complaint form and mail it in because my supervisor will not listen to me\". I was upset and I told him that this needed to be taken care of immediately but all he had to say was to mail in the complaint form. I found a local phone number on the complaint form and notified them. They took my info and that was that. I'm now real curious to know how they treated the first incident. You can't just clean the trains, heat or freeze treat them because people may still bring them in at any given time. If they did use chemicals, we have the right to know. The majority of products pest control companies use for bedbug treatments usually have follow up treatments that are recommended to be done every 2 weeks for no less than 3 treatments. BART is very sensitive and has thousands of daily commuters. I happen to be stuck in the middle because I am a faithful commuter and also in the pest control industry who happened to experience the horror of seeing a LIVE BEDBUG. I have many questions and concerns.\n",

However, this station is a convenient and a vital hub & transfer point of public transportation between areas of the Bay Area. People from San Francisco, Contra Costa, Alameda, and all over the bay flow through this station daily. Several BART lines go through this station, from Concord to Millbrae, Richmond to Fremont, and Richmond to Millbrae, though some lines only operate during weekdays and/or before 6pm, so check the timetables at the station, BART's website, or any form of media that associates with BART (i.e. BART app?).\n",

However, at $1 per day, this is the best station to park if you need to park your car before going into SF or farther down the East Bay, as other stations are farther away or will charge you more. There are 2-hour zones around the station and possible all-day free parking streets if you don't wish to pay. However, a few posts before this one claim vandalism, theft, and other criminal activity, so park at your own risk in or near this station.\n",

Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.

      "  Review 209: I would like to inform you that I am a Mon - Fri commuter. I take BART from El Cerrito del Norte and get off at Colma BART station. I had always been cautious about bedbugs and wondered why there haven't been any outbreaks on BART especially because people do bring them with them via their luggage while traveling. It's a fact! People can also bring them along if their homes are infested and they ride on BART they can easily fall off and land inside. As I left from work yesterday (4/22/2014) I got on the Pittsburg/Bay Point train. I was sitting inside train Number 1853 on the side seats right nest to the doors because I need easy access to exit since I was going to transfer on McArthur AND I'm pregnant, next to door #5. I usually place my backpack on the ground so I reached down to grab my backpack and placed it on my lap to get my gatorade drink. When I was done sipping on it, I placed my backpack back on the floor in between my legs. I had then noticed something moving on my left leg and I just thought it was a lint or something so I tried brushing it off but it would not come off, I then thought.... \"oh shit, this is a bedbug!\" so I grabbed it and sure enough it was a freaking bedbug! It was a pale brown color meaning it had not had a blood meal and it was not big enough to be an adult. It was still a nymph. Ironically, I work for a pest control company and I have been in the industry for over 10 years so I can tell you that what I saw and identified was 100% BEDBUG! As soon as I got off the train at El Cerrito del Norte, I notified the employee at the booth and all he said to me was, \"you need to fill out this complaint form and mail it in because my supervisor will not listen to me\". I was upset and I told him that this needed to be taken care of immediately but all he had to say was to mail in the complaint form. I found a local phone number on the complaint form and notified them. They took my info and that was that. I'm now real curious to know how they treated the first incident. You can't just clean the trains, heat or freeze treat them because people may still bring them in at any given time. If they did use chemicals, we have the right to know. The majority of products pest control companies use for bedbug treatments usually have follow up treatments that are recommended to be done every 2 weeks for no less than 3 treatments. BART is very sensitive and has thousands of daily commuters. I happen to be stuck in the middle because I am a faithful commuter and also in the pest control industry who happened to experience the horror of seeing a LIVE BEDBUG. I have many questions and concerns.\n",

After reading other reviews of this station, I thought, hey, I looked like one of the sketchy ones hanging about the Station, due to my rough night, crappy morning. But I didn't bother any other Bart riders by asking for money, or trying to sell a voided ticket, so yay! I needed to get home, get into my house, grab spare car keys and turn right around and come back to rescue Chick and redeem myself. \n",

It will make that area much more attractive. By the way, west of Macarthur station (Golden Gate District) is rapidly gentrifying. It's a gem waiting to be found.

They could also move the dumpsters away from the Emery-Go-Round stop so we don't have to smell stale garbage.  And it's not awesome that sometimes, the sheltered part of the shuttle waiting area becomes a sort of panhandling gulch.  (There's one clean and decently dressed guy who sits around drinking tall Starbucks drinks and asking for spare change, whom I consider to be my secret nemesis.  On the other hand, there is an industrious crack/crystal meth lady who climbs into recycling dumpsters to get a motherlode of cans/bottles for cash.)

Who can afford that every day, or wait until 10 to go to work? I'm now driving in after doing an analysis of all the other options. Goodbye BART, after riding for 15 years, I'm not sad to no longer be stuck in a packed train like a sardine anymore, especially since delays breakdowns that were once rare are now almost a daily occurrence.

I told him Embarcadero and he starts fiddling with the card with some little handheld machine and tells me last time it was used was on AC Transit.  I started to explain how it worked at Embarcadero and he held up his hand to stop me, and told me that it couldn't have worked and I must've come through on another passenger's BART card.  I tried to explain again, and he stopped me again with his little hand held high.\n",

      "  Review 145: Ok. Most evenings, when I get off Bart at Rockridge, there is a saxophone player there, squawking and bleating with a-tonal fervor. I normally love music. And I generally can block out bad music. But the sax player at Rockridge Bart in the evenings on weekdays is so deplorable, so deliberately and hideously foul, so without restraint intentionally awful, that I am finally compelled to yelp. I may never enter an other yelp. This may be my sole contribution to the yelp-o-sphere. No doubt many will disagree. And I accept that. No doubt it is in poor form, to review a street performer scraping change from the evening commute. No doubt this is completely subjective! And that some may truly like the screeches and blats and fingernail on chalkboard dying cat, horse in agony, truck wreck brake failure bridge collapse noises this man coaxes from his unhappy horn. Perhaps it is his artistic goal, to vex and trouble anyone within earshot, to give them a lesson in the complete absence of pleasantness, with an anti-musical hell bent assault on the very possibility of rhythm or melody, a rejection of all musical convention, like so many jazz students do before they realize it'll never get them laid, a putrid wallowing in the unnecessary, music as prank, as bratty insult, and if, if so, he is successful. I just had to go on record, once and for all, and howl into the wilderness, I DON'T LIKE IT!  There. I feel better. Thank you.\n",

And I generally can block out bad music.

I may never enter an other yelp. This may be my sole contribution to the yelp-o-sphere. No doubt many will disagree. And I accept that. No doubt it is in poor form, to review a street performer scraping change from the evening commute. No doubt this is completely subjective! And that some may truly like the screeches and blats and fingernail on chalkboard dying cat, horse in agony, truck wreck brake failure bridge collapse noises this man coaxes from his unhappy horn. Perhaps it is his artistic goal, to vex and trouble anyone within earshot, to give them a lesson in the complete absence of pleasantness, with an anti-musical hell bent assault on the very possibility of rhythm or melody, a rejection of all musical convention, like so many jazz students do before they realize it'll never get them laid, a putrid wallowing in the unnecessary, music as prank, as bratty insult, and if, if so, he is successful.

Parking should be able to be paid outside the station or online.

Parking at Rockridge is now nearly impossible on the street, since the city of Oakland has made what remaining streets that were formerly non-permitted within a 6-block area require a 4-hour permit. BART's lot fills by 7:30 am, so anyone who needs to drop off kids at school before heading off on their commute is out of luck, unless they want to pay $6/day for one of the few 10am spots--that go largely unused until they become regular $3 spots at 10 am, when they immediately fill. Who can afford that every day, or wait until 10 to go to work? I'm now driving in after doing an analysis of all the other options. Goodbye BART, after riding for 15 years, I'm not sad to no longer be stuck in a packed train like a sardine anymore, especially since delays breakdowns that were once rare are now almost a daily occurrence. The station is filthy too, as well as the bathroom. I saw a mess on the stairs marked with a cone for 4 days before it was cleaned up.\n",

      "  Review 173: In the ghetto... Yes I am a white girl and yes I live in East Oakland, and yes sometimes I walk home (it's about a 10 minute walk) from the Fruitvale Bart station.... after the incident I witnessed tonight I will think twice... It all went down at about 8:05 pm.... I had just stepped off the steep ass escalator and was about halfway to the exit when screams broke out.... I bolted for the exit and once safely outside watched to see the drama unfold...I turned around to see a woman screaming,\"grab him, stop him\".... Next thing I see is a guy grabs the man she is yelling about and holds on to him.... My eyes shift to the group of people surrounding the bottom of the elevator.... There is a woman laying there.... The woman who had been yelling grab him, started beating on the glass where the Bart employee stands asking her to call the police, call for help....The Bart employee stared at her blankly and the lady started screaming, \"do you speak English? Call someone for help....  That woman was just pushed down the escalator\"..... At this point I called 911 and was promptly told by a recording that all operators were busy..... Wow!!! That gives me a nice sense of safety! After 2 minutes the line picked up  and I told the operator I was at the Fruitvale Bart station, which at that point I was transferred to Bart police..... The police showed up moments later... and quickly handcuffed the woman who had been yelling!?!... Umm she's the one that was helping the victim (she was uncuffed about 5 minutes later) .... The man who had pushed the woman was also cuffed and asked to sit on a bench... At this point one of the officers went over to escalator to check on the woman that had been pushed... The other officer was talking to the man who had grabbed the \"bad guy\"..... At this point the \"bad guy\" tried to run and ran into a garbage can and fell to the ground... the cop ran over grabbed him up and he was ushered to the back of the police car.... At this point the fire department came and the lady at the bottom of the escalator was brought to her feet.... After gawking for about 15 minutes, calling my BF and having him come and gawk for another 5 minutes... I left the Bart station and put buy mace on my to do list..... 2 stars for the better then the new 90210 drama....\n",

After they ge their tickets, the con man  asks each of them for money, so they each gave him a couple of dollars.  When they pulled out their wallets the guy points out the fact that they had more money to give and asks them to cough up some more cash.  In the end he walked away with about $25.

But the bike lockers are in a dimly lite area. Access to AC transit is good but rarely can you make a connection between BART and a bus without waiting a while. Its best to have your money in hand if your using the ticket machines. If you stand there and fumble around youll be bait for the panhandlers and scammers. Using a clipper card gets you through this station and on your way. I strongly recommend getting one if you use this station a lot. There are some entertaining characters like the hallelujah guy,and the always sober church ladies handing watch tower flyers. The flea market is pretty cool and the guy selling bootleg CDs always has some awesome soul music cranked up to set a mood. The best mexican food truck in the area is  located on the corner of fruitvale and E14th street. There are open art studios and Ale Industries brewery located a block away on E11th . From this station your a nice bike trip away from the estuary shoreline, Oakland Rivera and Alameda. Parking is plentiful but fills up fast. Ive never had my vehicle busted into..knock..knock but i will repeat this..do not leave ANYTHING of value in your car whether your parking in or around the station on the surface streets. This is still a urban area so keep your guard up and youll be fine. Have fun and be SAFE.\n",

      "  Review 337: In the ghetto... Yes I am a white girl and yes I live in East Oakland, and yes sometimes I walk home (it's about a 10 minute walk) from the Fruitvale Bart station.... after the incident I witnessed tonight I will think twice... It all went down at about 8:05 pm.... I had just stepped off the steep ass escalator and was about halfway to the exit when screams broke out.... I bolted for the exit and once safely outside watched to see the drama unfold...I turned around to see a woman screaming,\"grab him, stop him\".... Next thing I see is a guy grabs the man she is yelling about and holds on to him.... My eyes shift to the group of people surrounding the bottom of the elevator.... There is a woman laying there.... The woman who had been yelling grab him, started beating on the glass where the Bart employee stands asking her to call the police, call for help....The Bart employee stared at her blankly and the lady started screaming, \"do you speak English? Call someone for help....  That woman was just pushed down the escalator\"..... At this point I called 911 and was promptly told by a recording that all operators were busy..... Wow!!! That gives me a nice sense of safety! After 2 minutes the line picked up  and I told the operator I was at the Fruitvale Bart station, which at that point I was transferred to Bart police..... The police showed up moments later... and quickly handcuffed the woman who had been yelling!?!... Umm she's the one that was helping the victim (she was uncuffed about 5 minutes later) .... The man who had pushed the woman was also cuffed and asked to sit on a bench... At this point one of the officers went over to escalator to check on the woman that had been pushed... The other officer was talking to the man who had grabbed the \"bad guy\"..... At this point the \"bad guy\" tried to run and ran into a garbage can and fell to the ground... the cop ran over grabbed him up and he was ushered to the back of the police car.... At this point the fire department came and the lady at the bottom of the escalator was brought to her feet.... After gawking for about 15 minutes, calling my BF and having him come and gawk for another 5 minutes... I left the Bart station and put buy mace on my to do list..... 2 stars for the better then the new 90210 drama....\n",

Coincidentally, there wasn't any security at the station at the time. This by the way, was not an isolated incident. When I have revisited this station on other occasions I have witnessed other people being approached in the same manner. What I do now whenever I board at this particular station is walk in a somewhat slow manner and allow others to get to the ticket machines first. Then when they get approached by the \"helpers\" I proceed to purchase my ticket at another machine. On a side note, this station gets pretty packed when there are Raider or A's games, so plan accordingly. I would absolutely avoid this station on game days unless you necessarily have to ride BART.\n",

I didnt ask her for her name because I couldn't bare to talk to her any more. She is an older African American woman, with glasses, and was wearing a hat. I advised her that the add fare function wasnt working as I was attempting to add more funds to my clipper card. The agent insinuated that I didnt pay entering Embarcadero and thus I couldnt add fare. Her tone and volume was such that it sounded like she was accusing me if intentionally walking through the gate knowing I didnt have enough money on my card. Um hello?! Why would I be wanting to pay? With my Clipper card, I was able to ge through the gates with no problem. Then she blamed me for walking too fast behind another rider. I told her that I ride Bart everyday and this is the first time this happened. Then she said, \"Well I have been doing this longer than you.\" The rude and condescending manner in which she talked to me was so unprofessional and uncalled for. She not once Offered a resolution. How can Bart employ someone who is highly visible and accessible to their riders, but treats them like shit? Its already enough that the Colliseum station is full of loiterers, harassers, assault, and theft. Yes, i have fallen victim unfortunately to all mentioned. You would think that to due to the station having a bad reputation, Bart employees would be more engaging, welcoming, and helpful. Please please please offer this woman more people trAining and tell her to get over herself! She was such an awful experience and damper in my day.

Without having to talk to anyone I was able to go straight from the airport to the Coliseum station, and from there the rest of the Bay Area.

      "  Review 40: I waited in line to exchange a few tickets, the person being helped had a complex issue resulting in a line of about 5 people forming behind me. To her credit the woman staffing the window called for someone to help with us customers. As the next person in line I thought great u can take care of my exchange and still make my train. However, B. Lopez apparently decided that the time of everyone in the line behind me was more important than mine. As she told me that she was going to sell them tickets before exchanging mine. I objected to this as I knew all of us wouldn't be helped before my train arrived, and maybe I'm being obtuse but I thought the point of a line was to help people in the order they arrived. It seems to me that if someone wasn't going to be helped it wouldn't be the person who'd been waiting the longest.... Again maybe I just don't know how lines work, but I'm pretty sure I understand the concept of lines. At a time when bart is complaining of falling ridership I don't understand why you hire employees who go out of there way to chase away loyal customers who've been riding bart for over 20 yrs. Being that my commute is the same whether I drive or bart it'll be a long time before I ride bart again. Since my time apparently means less than the time of others... Thanks but no thanks bart... maybe one day we'll all get fed up and execute a bart boycott, at least a brief one. After all they'll go on strike in a heartbeat, yes we need them, but they need us too and it's time they acknowledge that. Without us how would they pay all their $200k janitors...\n",

But being from L.A. even if there had been some, and it was'nt a hot lazy Sunday, I doubt it would have topped anything I have even seen down home. So we hop in the train at this station not far from where my friend Kevin grew up. The train was powerful, long and proud as it arrived. It was packed inside due to the Gay Pride Event in San Francisco. It took off so fast, almost throwing us to the floor! I wanted to rate it 5 stars but the air was'nt working and we all got hot and sweaty together whether we wanted to or not. Lol But all in all I was in awe of the world famous Bay Area Rapid Transit system. And I am probably not the first or last to say, just seeing it is not enough.\n",

No, that would be because its first level is designed very poorly.  From where we entered, we couldn't get to the station agent's window.  We wanted to talk to the station agent to explain to him that we couldn't tag our Clipper cards here because we had already tagged them in Berkeley without actually riding the train.  But it's impossible to get to the station agent's window from the north entrance; you have to go upstairs and come back down through the south entrance.  That's dumb, so we went through the emergency exit and waited to talk to him when we realized that we could just board the train since we had already tagged our Clipper cards.

It was disturbing a few passengers had to stick around just in case. I saw several Bart uniform employees waiting for a train. I walked and told them.  One of them peeked and said she has a gun. She can shoot him. They refused to go. I think that is Bart spirit for you in a not-nice area.

Bart needs to massively improve its cleanliness and need to enforce non loitering. It seems that on a daily basis the seats and floors do not get wiped or mopped as you can still smell in the morning  and all day trace of all kinds of body fluids. Bart would need to enforce also the ridership of patrons with valid Bart tickets and rides to ensure that seats are available legitimately as well as passenger comfort and safety. There are no Bart inspectors checking tickets. Compared to the trains in Asia and Europe, Bart needs to be massively improved hygiene and cleanliness side and ridership with valid tickets.  I would pay a little bit more to make this happen.\n",

The platform deserves four and maybe even five stars for its calmness, quiet, and lack of pushy commuters.  When East Bay-bound BART trains used to be more unreliable, I would sometimes hop a Dublin/Pleasanton or Fremont train from Civic Center in the hope that I could catch a Richmond train from Lake Merritt and get to Berkeley quicker than waiting for a direct Richmond train.  It worked out maybe a third of the time, but like I already mentioned, this platform is a nice place to wait, and no one seems to know that the first car is the best car, so I was usually sitting pretty--literally.\n",

No, that would be because its first level is designed very poorly.  From where we entered, we couldn't get to the station agent's window.  We wanted to talk to the station agent to explain to him that we couldn't tag our Clipper cards here because we had already tagged them in Berkeley without actually riding the train.  But it's impossible to get to the station agent's window from the north entrance; you have to go upstairs and come back down through the south entrance.  That's dumb, so we went through the emergency exit and waited to talk to him when we realized that we could just board the train since we had already tagged our Clipper cards.  So not only is it designed poorly, but this station's poor design encourages fare evasion.\n",

It was disturbing a few passengers had to stick around just in case. I saw several Bart uniform employees waiting for a train. I walked and told them.  One of them peeked and said she has a gun. She can shoot him. They refused to go. I think that is Bart spirit for you in a not-nice area.

Parking is ample (you can park in a choice of two lots--one covered and the other uncovered) and you can even park on side-streets, which is free, or in the Laney College lot too (but not past 10pm).  So parking is truly easy to find and cheap (free on the side streets or discounted at 50 cents for the Laney Lot).  \n",

The drive takes about 3-4 minutes by freeway, and the time that the Bart takes to go from Lake Merritt to Fruitvale is 6 minutes, so it's easy to be dropped off (and be on time) at either station if you miss a train at either station.\n",

It's proximity to Chinatown, its proximity to Laney College (especially for those taking classes there), its cleanliness and tidiness, and its enclosure in a safe, security-patrolled area.  Even though Lake Merritt BART is in Oakland, it's one of the safest BART stations.  Plus, since it's underground, it's free from the cold wintery winds of the Bay Area...so waiting for your train is not too big of a deal since it's warm down there!\n",

The subway stations in NYC are by far smellier and dirtier than any BART station I've been in.  I don't think I've seen so much as a mouse in the Lake Merrit BART, but go to almost any subway station in NYC or Boston and you're sure to see large rats on the tracks.

      "  Review 510: I waited in line to exchange a few tickets, the person being helped had a complex issue resulting in a line of about 5 people forming behind me. To her credit the woman staffing the window called for someone to help with us customers. As the next person in line I thought great u can take care of my exchange and still make my train. However, B. Lopez apparently decided that the time of everyone in the line behind me was more important than mine. As she told me that she was going to sell them tickets before exchanging mine. I objected to this as I knew all of us wouldn't be helped before my train arrived, and maybe I'm being obtuse but I thought the point of a line was to help people in the order they arrived. It seems to me that if someone wasn't going to be helped it wouldn't be the person who'd been waiting the longest.... Again maybe I just don't know how lines work, but I'm pretty sure I understand the concept of lines. At a time when bart is complaining of falling ridership I don't understand why you hire employees who go out of there way to chase away loyal customers who've been riding bart for over 20 yrs. Being that my commute is the same whether I drive or bart it'll be a long time before I ride bart again. Since my time apparently means less than the time of others... Thanks but no thanks bart... maybe one day we'll all get fed up and execute a bart boycott, at least a brief one. After all they'll go on strike in a heartbeat, yes we need them, but they need us too and it's time they acknowledge that. Without us how would they pay all their $200k janitors...\n",
